Preface
The National Curriculum Framework (NCF) advocates the promotion of skill oriented,
life skill-based, employment-driven and value-based school education. It envisions
developing the human capital dedicated to nation, nationality, national integrity and
Nepali specialty. The English textbook for Grade 12 has been prepared following the
spirit of NCF 2076 and Secondary Level Curriculum 2076 (Grade 11 and Grade12).
An attempt has also been made to incorporate the emerging needs of learners. The
book includes the contents to develop all four language skills blended in the tasks and
activities with contextual grammar and related vocabulary.
The book has two sections: language development and literature. The language
development section includes a range of contemporary issue-based local and global
thematic texts intended to develop intensive reading skills and foster competence in
grammar, vocabulary, speech and writing. The literature section includes genre-based
literary texts for both intensive and extensive reading, so as to enable the learners to
discern different aspects of the literary texts and practise creative writing. Each text
is followed by adequate exercises to foster creativity and critical interpretation in the
learners along with interactive skills and sensitivity about the culture and tradition.
This textbook is compiled and written by Dr. Bam Dev Adhikari, Mr. Khum Prasad
Sharma and Mr. Bal Bahadur Thapa. It has been extensively improved and edited by
Prof. Dr. Jib Lal Sapkota, Prof. Dr. Rishi Ram Rijal, Dr. Gopal Prasad Pandey, Mr. Nim
Prakash Singh Rathaur, Mr. Shankar Adhikari and Mr. Nabin Kumar Khadka. Several
personalities, notably the Director General Mr. Ana Prasad Neupane, the Director
Mr. Tuka Raj Adhikari, Mr. Madhav Prasad Ghimire and Ms. Maiya Pokharel, have
also contributed in shaping the book in this form. Several experts and practitioners: Mr.
Ananda Dhungana, Mr. Lal Mani Joshi, Mr. Matrika Subedi, Mr. Ramesh Dhakal and
Mr. Pashupati Pandya contributed to the revision and development of the tasks. The
illustration of the book has been done by Shree Hari Shrestha and the layout design by
Khados Sunuwar. The Curriculum Development Centre (CDC) extends sincere thanks
to all of them. With the view that teaching of English should be based on the authentic
materials, the reading texts and the audio texts have been taken from various sources.
The Centre would like to extend its acknowledgements to all of those sources.
The Centre always welcomes constructive feedback for the betterment of its
publications.

Critical Thinking

Reading
Know Thyself
Before you read
a.
b.

What are critical thinking skills?
How do critical thinkers solves the problems? Guess the steps they follow while
tackling a problem.

Read the following text and do the given tasks.
There was a lot of shuffling around when the bell rang and everybody got up to leave.
I checked my schedule and it said my next class was English, room 321. I didn’t stop
to see if anyone else from my homeroom was going my way: I just zoomed out of the
class and down the hall and sat down as far from the front as possible. The teacher, a
really tall man with a yellow beard, was writing on the chalkboard.
Kids came in laughing and talking in little groups but I didn’t look up. Basically, the
same thing that happened in homeroom happened again: no one sat next to me except
for Jack, who was joking around with some kids who weren’t in our homeroom. I
could tell Jack was the kind of kid other kids like. He had a lot of friends. He made
people laugh.
When the second bell rang, everyone got quiet and the teacher turned around and faced
us. He said his name was Mr. Browne, and then he started talking about what we would
be doing this semester. At a certain point, somewhere between A Wrinkle in Time and
Shen of the Sea, he noticed me but kept right on talking.
I was mostly doodling in my notebook while he talked, but every once in a while I
would sneak a look at the other students. Charlotte was in this class. So were Julian
and Henry. Miles wasn’t.
Mr. Browne had written on the chalkboard in big block letters:
2

English: Grade 12

P-R-E-C-E-P-T!
“Okay, everybody write this down
at the very top of the very first
page in your English notebook.”
As we did what he told us to do,
he said: “Okay, so who can tell me
what a precept is? Does anyone
know?”
No one raised their hands.
Mr. Browne smiled, nodded, and
turned around to write on the
chalkboard again:
PRECEPTS = RULES ABOUT REALLY IMPORTANT THINGS!
“Like a motto?” someone called out.
“Like a motto!” said Mr. Browne, nodding as he continued writing on the board. “Like
a famous quote. Like a line from a fortune cookie. Any saying or ground rule that
can motivate you. Basically, a precept is anything that helps guide us when making
decisions about really important things.”
He wrote all that on the chalkboard and then turned around and faced us. “So, what are
some really important things?” he asked us.
A few kids raised their hands, and as he pointed at them, they gave their answers,
which he wrote on the chalkboard in really, really sloppy handwriting:
RULES. SCHOOLWORK. HOMEWORK.
“What else?” he said as he wrote, not even turning around. “Just call things out!” He
wrote everything everyone called out.
FAMILY. PARENTS. PETS.
One girl called out: “The environment!”
THE ENVIRONMENT.
He wrote on the chalkboard, and added:
OUR WORLD!
“Sharks, because they eat dead things in the ocean!” said one of the boys, a kid named
Reid, and Mr. Browne wrote down
SHARKS.
“Bees!” “Seatbelts!” “Recycling!” “Friends!”
“Okay,” said Mr. Browne, writing all those things down. He turned around when he
finished writing to face us again. “But no one’s named the most important thing of all.”
English: Grade 12

We all looked at him, out of ideas.
“God?” said one kid, and I could tell that even though Mr. Browne wrote “God” down, that
wasn’t the answer he was looking for. Without saying anything else, he wrote down:
WHO WE ARE!
“Who we are,” he said, underlining each word as he said it. “Who we are! Us! Right?
What kind of people are we? What kind of person are you? Isn’t that the most important
thing of all? Isn’t that the kind of question we should be asking ourselves all the time?
“What kind of person am I?
“Did anyone happen to notice the plaque next to the door of this school? Anyone read
what it says? Anyone?”
He looked around but no one knew the answer.
“It says: ‘Know Thyself,’ ” he said, smiling and nodding. “And learning who you are
is what you’re here to do.”
“I thought we were here to learn English,” Jack cracked, which made everyone laugh.
“Oh yeah, and that, too!” Mr. Browne answered, which I thought was very cool of him.
He turned around and wrote in big huge block letters that spread all the way across the
chalkboard:
MR. BROWNE’S SEPTEMBER PRECEPT:
WHEN GIVEN THE CHOICE BETWEEN BEING
RIGHT OR BEING KIND, CHOOSE KIND.
“Okay, so, everybody,” he said, facing us again, “I want you to start a brand-new
section in your notebooks and call it Mr. Browne’s Precepts.”
He kept talking as we did what he was telling us to do.
“Put today’s date at the top of the first page. And from now on, at the beginning of
every month, I’m going to write a new Mr. Browne precept on the chalkboard and
you’re going to write it down in your notebook. Then we’re going to discuss that
precept and what it means. And at the end of the month, you’re going to write an essay
about it, about what it means to you. So by the end of the year, you’ll all have your own
list of precepts to take away with you.
“Over the summer, I ask all my students to come up with their very own personal precept,
write it on a postcard, and mail it to me from wherever you go on your summer vacation.”
“People really do that?” said one girl whose name I didn’t know.
“Oh yeah!” he answered, “people really do that. I’ve had students send me new precepts
years after they’ve graduated from this school, actually. It’s pretty amazing.”
He paused and stroked his beard.
“But, anyway, next summer seems like a long way off, I know,” he joked, which made
us laugh. “So, everybody relax a bit while I take attendance, and then when we’re
4

English: Grade 12

finished with that, I’ll start telling you about all the fun stuff we’re going to be doing
this year—in English.” He pointed to Jack when he said this, which was also funny, so
we all laughed at that.
As I wrote down Mr. Browne’s September precept, I suddenly realized that I was going
to like school. No matter what.
- R.J. Palacio (excerpt from Wonder)

Family

Reading
Family
Before you read
a.
b.

Do you live in a small family or a big family? Which type of family do you like?
Why?
How important is family to you? How important is it in your culture?

Read the following text about family and do the given tasks.
At its most basic, a family consists of an adult and his or her offspring. Most commonly,
it consists of two married adults, usually a man and a woman (almost always from
different lineages and not related by blood) along with their offspring, usually living
in a private and separate dwelling. This type of unit, more specifically known as a
nuclear family, is believed to be the oldest of the various types of families in existence.
Sometimes the family includes not only the parents and their unmarried children living
at home but also children that have married, their spouses, and their offspring, and
possibly elderly dependents as well; such an arrangement is called an extended family.
At its best, the family performs various valuable functions for its members. Perhaps
most important of all, it provides for emotional and psychological security, particularly
through the warmth, love, and companionship that living together generates between
spouses and in turn between them and their children. The family also provides a
valuable social and political function by institutionalizing procreation and by providing
guidelines for the regulation of sexual conduct. The family additionally provides
such other socially beneficial functions as the rearing and socialization of children,
along with such humanitarian activities as caring for its members when they are sick
or disabled. On the economic side, the family provides food, shelter, clothing, and
physical security for its members, some of whom may be too young or too old to
provide for the basic necessities of life themselves. Finally, on the social side, the
English: Grade 12

9

family may serve to promote order and stability within society as a whole.
Historically, in most cultures, the family was patriarchal, or male-dominated. Perhaps
the most striking example of the male-dominated family is the description of the family
given in the Hebrew Bible (or Old Testament), where the male heads of the clans were
allowed to have several wives as well as concubines. As a general rule, women had
a rather low status. In Roman times the family was still patriarchal, but polygamy
was not practiced, and in general the status of women was somewhat improved over
that suggested in the Hebrew Bible, although they still were not allowed to manage
their own affairs. The Roman family was an extended one. The family as it existed in
medieval Europe was male-dominated and extended.
In the West, industrialization and the accompanying urbanization spawned—and
continue to spawn—many changes in family structure by causing a sharp change in life
and occupational styles. Many people, particularly unmarried youths, left farms and
went to urban centres to become industrial workers. This process led to the dissolution
of many extended families.
The modern family that emerged after the Industrial Revolution is different from the
earlier model. For instance, patriarchal rule began to give way to greater equality
between the sexes. Similarly, family roles once considered exclusively male or female
broke down. Caring for the home and children, once the exclusive duty of the female,
is often a shared activity, as, increasingly, is the earning of wages and the pursuit of
public life, once the exclusive domain of the male. The structure of the family is also
changing in that some couples choose not to marry legally and instead elect to have
their children out of wedlock; many of these informal relationships tend to be of short
duration, and this—as well as the rise in levels of divorce—has led to a rapid increase
in the number of one-parent households.
Family law varies from culture to culture, but in its broadest application it defines
the legal relationships among family members as well as the relationships between
families and society at large. Some of the important questions dealt with in family
law include the terms and parameters of marriage, the status of children, and the
succession of property from one generation to the next. In nearly every case,
family law represents a delicate balance between the interests of society and the
protection of individual rights.
The general rule in marriages until modern times was the legal transfer of dependency,
that of the bride, from father to groom. Not only did the groom assume guardianship,
he usually assumed control over all of his wife’s affairs. Often, the woman lost any
legal identity through marriage, as was the case in English common law. There have
been exceptions to this practice. Muslim women, for instance, had considerable control
over their own personal property. The use of dowries, an amount of money or property
given to the husband with the bride in compensation for her dependency, has long been
10

English: Grade 12

practiced in many countries, but it has tended to disappear in many industrial societies.
In general, modern marriage is best-described as a voluntary union, usually between a
man and a woman (although there are still vestiges of the arranged marriage that once
flourished in eastern Europe and Asia). The emancipation of women in the 19th and
20th centuries changed marriage dramatically, particularly in connection with property
and economic status. By the mid-20th century, most Western countries had enacted
legislation establishing equality between spouses. Similarly changed is the concept
of economic maintenance, which traditionally fell on the shoulders of the husband.
Though many laws still lean toward this view, there was increasing recognition of a
woman’s potential to contribute to the support of the family. At the beginning of the
21st century, family law and the notion of family itself was further complicated by
calls for acceptance of same-sex marriages and nontraditional families.
Dissolution of marriages is one of the areas in which laws must try to balance private
and public interest, since realistically it is the couple itself that can best decide whether
its marriage is viable. In many older systems—e.g., Roman, Muslim, Jewish, Chinese,
and Japanese—some form of unilateral divorce was possible, requiring only one party
to give notice of the intention, usually the male. Most modern systems recognize a
mutual request for divorce, though many require an attempt to reconcile before granting
divorce. Extreme circumstances, in which blatant neglect, abuse, misbehaviour, or
incapacity can be demonstrated, find resolution in civil court. Many systems favour
special family courts that attempt to deal more fairly with sensitive issues such as
custody of children.
The issue of children poses special problems for family law. In nearly every culture,
the welfare of children was formerly left to the parents entirely, and this usually
meant the father. Most societies have come to recognize the general benefit of
protecting children’s rights and of prescribing certain standards of rearing. Thus,
more than in any other area, family law intervenes in private lives with regard to
children. Compulsory education is an example of the law superseding parental
authority. In the case of single-parent homes, the law will frequently provide some
form of support. Legislation on child labour and child abuse also asserts society’s
responsibility for a child’s best interests.
The succession of family interests upon the death of its members can be considered
a part of family law. Most legal systems have some means of dealing with division
of property left by a deceased family member. The will, or testament, specifies the
decedent’s wishes as to such distribution, but a surviving spouse or offspring may
contest what appear to be unreasonable or inequitable provisions. There are also laws
that recognize family claims in the event that property is left intestate (i.e., with no will
to determine its distribution).

Italy wins Euro 2020, beats England in penalty shoot-out
By Associated Press
LONDON, July 12: Italian soccer’s redemption story is complete. England’s painful
half-century wait for a major title goes on.
And it just had to be because of a penalty
shootout.
Italy won the European Championship for
the second time by beating England 3-2 on
penalties on Sunday. The match finished 1-1
after extra time at Wembley Stadium, which
was filled mostly with English fans hoping to
celebrate the team’s first international trophy
since the 1966 World Cup.
English: Grade 12

17

“It’s coming to Rome. It’s coming to Rome,” Italy defender Leonardo Bonucci shouted
into a TV camera amid the celebrations, mocking the famous lyric “it’s coming home”
from the England team’s anthem.
For England, it was utter dejection again — they know the feeling so well when it
comes to penalties — after Gianluigi Donnarumma, Italy’s imposing goalkeeper, dived
to his left and saved the decisive spot kick by 19-year-old Londoner Bukayo Saka, one
of the youngest players in England’s squad.
That was England’s third straight failure from the penalty spot in the shootout, with
Marcus Rashford and Jadon Sancho — players brought on late in extra time seemingly
as specialist penalty-takers — also missing.
As Saka and Sancho cried, Donnarumma was mobbed by his teammates as they
sprinted toward him from the halfway line at the end of the second penalty shootout in
a European Championship final.
Then Italy’s jubilant players headed to the other end of the field and ran as one, diving
to the ground in front of the Italian fans who have witnessed a rebirth of their national
team.
It was less than four years ago that Italy plunged to the lowest moment of its soccer
history by failing to qualify for the World Cup for the first time in six decades. Now,
they are the best team in Europe and on a national-record 34-match unbeaten run under
Roberto Mancini, their suave coach who has won an international trophy in his first
attempt to add to the country’s other European title — in 1968 — and its four World
Cups.
Mancini joined his players on the podium as Italy captain Giorgio Chiellini lifted the
Henri Delaunay trophy to the backdrop of fireworks and tickertape.
“It was impossible even to just consider this at one stage,” Mancini said, “but the guys
were just amazing. I have no words for them.”
For England, it’s the latest heartache in shootouts at major tournaments, after defeats
in 1990, 1996, 1998, 2004, 2006 and 2012. They ended that losing streak by beating
Colombia on penalties in the round of 16 at the 2018 World Cup, but the pain has
quickly returned.
“The boys couldn’t have given more,” England captain Harry Kane said. “Penalties
are the worst feeling in the world when you lose. It’s been a fantastic tournament — we
should be proud, hold our heads up high. It’s going to hurt now; it’s going to hurt for
a while.”
England’s first major final in 55 years had all started so well, too, with Luke Shaw
scoring the fastest goal in a European Championship final by meeting a cross from
opposite wing back Kieran Trippier with a half-volley that went in off the post in the
second minute.
It was Shaw’s first goal for England and it prompted a fist-pump between David
18

English: Grade 12

Beckham and Tom Cruise in the VIP box amid an explosion of joy around Wembley,
which had at least 67,000 fans inside. Maybe more, given dozens of ticketless England
fans managed to barge their way past stewards and police and into the stadium in
unsettling scenes before kickoff.
That was the only time Italy’s famously robust defense was really opened up in the
entire 120 minutes.
Indeed, after Shaw’s goal, England barely saw the ball for the rest of the game.
Italy’s midfielders dominated possession, as widely predicted before the match, and
England simply resorted to dropping deep and getting nine or even all 10 outfield
players behind the ball. It was reminiscent of the 2018 World Cup semifinals, when
England also scored early against Croatia then spent most of the game chasing its
opponent’s midfield before losing in extra time.
Italy’s equalizer was merited and Bonucci was the unlikely scorer. He put the ball in
from close range after a right-wing corner was flicked on to Marco Verratti, whose
stooping header was tipped onto the post by goalkeeper Jordan Pickford.
England managed to hold on for extra time — the way three of the last six European
finals went — and actually had the better of the final stages.
Just not the shootout, again.
After the misses of Rashford — he stuttered up to the ball and then hit the post — and
Sancho, whose shot was saved by Donnarumma again down to his left, Jorginho had
the chance to win it for Italy.
Incredibly, the midfielder who converted the decisive penalty in a shootout win over
Spain in the semifinals also failed to score as Pickford tipped the effort off the post.
It was Donnarumma who then made the crucial saves and within minutes he had also
been named player of the tournament, the first goalkeeper to be so honored.
So instead of coming home, the trophy is headed to Rome.
“We’d heard it day in, day out from Wednesday night — we heard it would be coming
home to London,” Bonucci said. “I’m sorry for them, but the cup will be taking a nice
flight, making its way to Rome so Italians all over the world can savor this.”

Do you know the means of transportation shown in the pictures? What are they?
Do you enjoy travelling at high speed? How do you feel when you travel at high
speed?
What means of transportation do you think we will be using in 50 years' time?
What makes you think so?

Read the following text about an ultra-high-speed ground transportation system
called hyperloop and do the given tasks.
A hyperloop, as you may have heard, is an ultra-high-speed ground transportation
system for passenger and cargo. It could
see freight and passengers travelling
as high as 760mph (1,220 km/h), in a
‘floating’ pod which shoots through
giant, low-pressure tubes, either above
or below ground. It is a newer form of
transport, currently being explored and
developed by a number of companies.
A hyperloop technology is still in
development even though the basic
concept has been around for many years.
The earliest hyperloop was likely to be
up and running by 2020 but most services are expected to be later, as trials of the
technology are still in their early stages.
There are two big differences between hyperloop and traditional rail. Firstly, the pods
carrying passengers travel through tubes or tunnels from which most of the air has
been removed to reduce friction. This should allow the pods to travel at up to 760 miles
per hour. Secondly, rather than using wheels like a train or car, the pods are designed
English: Grade 12

27

to float on air skis, using the same basic idea as an air hockey table, or use magnetic
levitation to reduce friction.
A hyperloop could be cheaper and faster than train or car travel, and cheaper and less
polluting than air travel. It is also quicker and cheaper to build than traditional highspeed rail. A hyperloop could therefore be used to take the pressure off gridlocked
roads, making travel between cities easier, and potentially unlocking major economic
benefits as a result.
What is the history of a hyperloop?
The idea of using low-pressure or vacuum tubes as part of a transport system has
a long heritage. The Crystal Palace Pneumatic Railway used air pressure to push a
wagon uphill (and a vacuum to drag it back down) way back in Victorian south London
in 1864. Similar systems using pneumatic tubes to send mail and packages between
buildings have been in use since the late nineteenth century, and can still be seen in
supermarkets and banks to move money around today.
One clear predecessor of the hyperloop is the 'vactrain' concept developed by Robert
Goddard early in the twentieth century; since then, many similar ideas have been
proposed without much success.
However, it was entrepreneur Elon Musk who really reignited interest in the concept
with his 'Hyperloop Alpha' paper in August 2013, which set out how a modern system
would work and how much it would cost.
How does a hyperloop tube work?
The basic idea of hyperloop as envisioned by Musk is that the passenger pods or
capsules travel through a tube, either
above or below ground. To reduce
friction, most but not all of the air is
removed from the tubes by pumps.
Overcoming air resistance is one of
the biggest uses of energy in high
speed travel. Airliners climb to high
altitudes to travel through less dense
air; in order to create a similar effect
at ground level, hyperloop encloses
the capsules in a reduced-pressure tube, effectively allowing the trains to travel at
airplane speeds while still on the ground.
In Musk's model, the pressure of the air inside the hyperloop tube is about one-sixth
the pressure of the atmosphere on Mars (a notable comparison as Mars is another of
Musk's interests). This means an operating pressure of 100 pascals, which reduces
the drag force of the air by 1,000 times relative to sea level conditions, and would be
equivalent to flying above 150,000 feet.
28

English: Grade 12

How do hyperloop capsules work?
The hyperloop capsules in Musk's model float above the tube's surface on a set of 28
air-bearing skis, similar to the way that
the puck floats just above the table on an
air hockey game. One major difference
is that it is the pod, not the track, which
generates the air cushion in order to keep
the tube as simple and cheap as possible.
Other versions of hyperloop use magnetic
levitation rather than air skis to keep the
passenger pods above the tracks.
The pod would get its initial velocity from
an external linear electric motor, which would accelerate it to 'high subsonic velocity'
and then give it a boost every 70 miles or so; in between, the pod would coast along in
near vacuum. Each capsule could carry 28 passengers (other versions aim to carry up
to 40) plus some luggage; another version of the pods could carry cargo and vehicles.
Pods would depart every two minutes (or every 30 seconds at peak usage).
How would a hyperloop be powered?
The pods will get their velocity from an external linear electric motor-effectively a
round induction motor (like the one in the Tesla Model S) rolled flat. Under Musk's
model, the Hyperloop would be powered by solar panels placed on the top of the tube
which would allow the system to generate more energy than it needs to run.
What will it feel like to travel in a hyperloop?
Critics of hyperloop have warned that travelling in the tube might be an uncomfortable
experience, due to nausea-inducing acceleration, plus lateral G-force on bends in the
route. However, Virgin Hyperloop One says that a journey via hyperloop will feel
about the same as riding in an elevator or a passenger plane.
"Although a hyperloop will be fast, the systems we are building will accelerate
with the same tolerable G-forces as that of taking off in a Boeing 747," it said.
Acceleration and deceleration will be gradual, it added, with no G-forces and
turbulence.
Travelling in a concrete pipe in a windowless pod means there isn't going to be much
to look at; Musk's original vision said that "beautiful landscape will be displayed in
the cabin" and each passenger will have access to their own personal entertainment
system.
Will a hyperloop be a success?
That's the huge, multibillion dollar and, as yet, unanswered question. The concept has
been around for a long time, but until now the technology has been lacking. This time
English: Grade 12

29

around, it's possible that the technology may have just caught up with the concept.
There are well-funded companies racing to be the first to deliver a working service
but, despite their optimistic timescales, these projects are still very much in the pilot
and experimental stages. Going from short test routes to hundreds of kilometres of
track is a big jump that none of these firms has made yet.
If the technology is still in development, that's also very true of the business models
to support it. The success of hyperloop will vary depending on the destinations, local
economics, and geography. Trying to build a new line overland across England, for
example, can prove an expensive and complicated business which can take many years
(as the ongoing HS2 controversy has shown). In other countries where land is cheaper
or where routes can travel through less populated areas, it may be easier to get services
up and running faster.
Capacity is another issue. It's not clear that hyperloop can do a better job of moving a
large number of people than other mass transit options. Critics argue that lots of pods
will be required to achieve the same passenger numbers as more traditional rail, which
uses much bigger carriages. And there are many engineering hurdles to overcome,
like building the tubes strong enough to deal with the stresses of carrying the highspeed pods, and finding energy- and cost- efficient ways to keep them operating at low
pressure.
Moving from a successful test to a full commercial deployment is a big jump, and
passenger trials are still to come. Assuming that consumers are happy being zoomed
around in these tubes, finding the right price for the service will be vital, too.
Right now hyperloop is at an experimental stage, even if the companies involved are
very keen to talk about its potential.

A Story of My Childhood
Before you read

them who they should be.” Do you agree or not?
Share one of your interesting childhood memories.

b.

Read the following childhood memory of Indian scientist, A. P. J. Abdul Kalam
and do the given tasks.
‘Vanakkam, Aiya! I have some good news for you!’It was my Mathematics teacher
from class four and he was standing just outside the house and calling out to my
father. He looked quite excited, so we all rushed out to greet him and invite him inside.
My father offered him a seat and then looked on
expectantly.
‘Abdul, come up here, to me,’ my teacher beckoned
to me. I was standing with all the other children,
peeping from behind my elder brother. I came up
shyly to him. He pulled me close affectionately, then
turned to my father and said, ‘Abdul has scored full
marks in Mathematics in the exam! And not only in
Mathematics but in Science as well, and he has done
very well in English and Tamil too! We teachers are very proud of him.’
I was so pleased to hear this result. But I was even more pleased because my teacher
had taken the trouble to come all the way to my house to tell us about this. He had
finished his work at the school, and then instead of hurrying back home he had come
here, to share his pride and happiness with my family. Our school was small, but it had
many such teachers like him. They taught us with love and care and felt the same joy
36

English: Grade 12

in our achievements as we did.
That evening, my mother made special poli (a flat chapatti-shaped sweet) to celebrate.
We all loved polis and ate many helpings till we were told we’d had enough and sent
off to bed in case we got tummy aches! My love for this sweet endures to this day, and
when I travel in south India, I have friends who make it at home and bring it to me
wherever I am. I make sure to steal a few minutes from my schedule and enjoy this
sweet dish that carries so many memories of childhood for me.
As a child, my day started very early. It began with my mother gently shaking me
awake very early in the morning, before sunrise. ‘Abdul, wake up kanna,’ she would
call affectionately and I got up, wiping the sleep from my eyes. I had two places to go
to before school. One was the Arabic tuition class that all of us attended. There, we
learnt to read the Koran. After it was over, I went to my Mathematics teacher’s house.
He took a special class for students who showed promise in the subject. I have always
loved learning about numbers and their rules and patterns. I had learnt addition and
subtraction, and multiplication, and all the other basic functions very quickly. Now I
was raring to know about more complex problems. My teacher had started the class for
students just like me and I enjoyed going there and grappling with number problems
in the early hours of the day.
I ran back home once the class was over. My mother would have a hot meal ready. We
all ate our fill. In our school, children did not carry tiffin boxes and water bottles so I
ate the mid-morning meal hungrily, enjoying the rice and vegetables and chutney and
dal. Some days she would make piping hot dosas and I still remember their thick crispy
texture and the spicy powder smeared on
them.
The children all walked to school together.
Our school was the Rameswaram
Elementary School and the only one in the
town then. We walked along the cobbled
roads together, chatting and playing little
games. We had to carry only a few books
with us and no one took schoolbags. The
school building had rows of classrooms
and a small playground. In the class I sat
with RamanadhaSastry, my best friend.
We had known each other from the first
day we came to school and had been friends ever since. He and I loved to chat and
somehow we never ran out of things to say to each other and do together.
One day, we decided that we would build boats made of leaves and keep them ready in
case it rained. Whenever we got a break between classes we took up our pile of leaves
and made little boats out of them. Imagine our joy when it actually rained that day!
English: Grade 12

37

Our whole fleet of boats set sail on the puddles. If I saw an ant or some other insect I
carefully made sure it got a ride on my boat to safety. I don’t know if the ants were any
grateful for this unexpected joyride, but we were thrilled to see them clinging on to the
flimsy leaf boats and sail away.
Ramanadhan and I sat next to each other in class. Once it so happened that a new
teacher joined our school. As soon as he entered the class, he saw from our attire that
Ramanadhan was a Brahmin and that I was a Muslim. These were divisions we had
never thought of earlier but the teacher was not happy that a Hindu and a Muslim boy
were sitting together. He made me get up and go sit elsewhere. I was shocked and
heartbroken. I remember crying because I had been made to give up my seat next to
my best friend. And, who knew that a Muslim and a Hindu boy could not sit together?
That evening, Ramanadhan’s father, who was also head priest at the Rameswaram
Shiva temple, heard about this and told my father about it. Together, they spoke to
the teacher and told him that he should not have brought the divisions of religion into
the classroom. Children should grow up together, studying and playing, without their
faiths coming in between. The teacher understood this and Ramanadhan and I went
back to sitting together as usual.
However, our time together was not indefinite. Soon we had to go our separate ways.
The school in Rameswaram had classes only till the secondary level and to study further
one had to go to the bigger towns nearby. I had another teacher called Sivasubramania
Iyer. He, too, was very fond of me and like Jalaluddin, kept encouraging me to think
about higher studies.
Sivasubramania Iyer taught me when I was ten years old and in the fifth standard. He
was a great teacher and all of us loved to attend his class and listen to him. One day, he
was teaching how birds fly. He drew a diagram of a bird on the blackboard depicting
the wings, tail and the body structure. He explained how birds create the lift and fly.
He also explained to us how they change direction while flying. For nearly twenty-five
minutes, he gave the lecture with various information such as lift, drag and how birds
fly in formations of ten, twenty or thirty. At the end of the class, he wanted to know
whether we had understood what he had been teaching. I spoke up and said I had not
understood. When I said this, he asked the other students whether they had understood
or not. Many students then said that they too had not understood. Our response did not
upset him at all.
When we were scheduled to have our next class with him, he had a wonderful surprise.
He said that he would take us to the seashore that evening! The whole class went to
the seashore of Rameswaram. We enjoyed looking out at the roaring waves. In the
sky, there were many birds flying around. He pointed out the birds that were flying in
formations of ten or twenty numbers and we observed the marvelous flight formations
they made. He asked us to watch how they looked when they were in flight and how
they flapped their wings. He then told us to look at the tail and see how they used the
38

English: Grade 12

combination of flapping wings and twisting tail in their flying. We noticed closely and
found that the birds were able to fly in the direction they wanted to by using both tail
and wings.
Then he asked us, ‘Where is the engine in this bird? Do you know what engine powers
each bird?’ He explained that each bird is powered by its own life force and the
motivation of what it wants. In the space of fifteen minutes, he explained the concept
of flight dynamics in birds and we understood everything. He gave us a theoretical
lesson coupled with a live practical example available in nature. This was real teaching.
That evening, I did not merely understand how a bird flies. It went much deeper. I
felt as though the bird’s flight entered into me and created a special feeling. From that
evening, I was sure that my future study had to be with reference to flight and flight
systems. My teacher’s teaching and the event that I witnessed decided my career path.
One evening after the classes, I asked him, ‘Sir, please tell me, how can I progress further
in learning all about flight?’ He patiently explained to me that I should complete my
eighth standard here, and then go to high school. After that, I should go to engineering
college where I would be able to learn about flight. If I completed each step, I would
beable to do something connected with flight sciences. This advice and the lesson that
evening by the seashore, gave me a goal and a mission for my life.

QR Code
Before you read
a.
b.

How do you usually pay for the things you buy?
Have you ever paid using QR Codes? Share your experiences.

Read the following text about QR code and do the given tasks.
Quick Response Codes – more commonly known
as QR codes - are an increasingly common form of
merchant payment, with its origins in South East
Asia, in particular, Japan and, later, China. The
international standard ISO/IEC 18004 for QR codes
was approved in 2000. Its first adoption and use in
mobile phones came with the rise of the smartphone,
when it was used to access information (for example,
extracting URLs from posters in public places). For
payments, proprietary standards were adopted by
Tencent and Alibaba, and the payments industry
standard was developed by EMVCo in 2017.
As an important step in increasing customer familiarity with the codes, QR codes were
44

English: Grade 12

adopted as an integration service for Tencent’s social media service WeChat, allowing
face-to-face ‘friending’ by scanning a QR code displayed on a friend’s mobile phone
screen. Later QR codes were adopted for use in the Alipay service to facilitate Alibaba
payments. At the same time WeChat was extended to include WeChat Pay, a payment
service directly integrated into the social media service. Both Alipay and WeChat
Pay now support both face-to-face and remote payments, the latter encompassing
e-commerce and bill payments, including utilities.
There are two broad models to a QR code payment service in a face-to-face environment:
either the user presents a QR code for scanning by the merchant, or the merchant
presents a QR code for scanning by the user.
Where the customer presents a QR code, the
transaction value can be set by the merchant
before scanning and communicated to the
customer. On agreement, the QR code is scanned,
and the merchant’s terminal requests payment
from the customer’s account, either directly from
the scheme operator or via an acquirer. Both the
customer and the merchant receive a notification
of the success or failure of the payment, and the
merchant then hands over the goods. In this model, the customer is vulnerable to an
unscrupulous merchant setting (and obscuring) the wrong transaction value before
scanning. Such a scheme therefore needs a robust claims mechanism.
Where the customer scans the merchant’s QR code – which may be useful in some
environments, such as quick service retail or market stalls – the transaction is
potentially more complex. If the transaction value is fixed, the customer can scan the
code, review the transaction details (including the merchant name and value), and
agree to the transaction, which is then forwarded to the scheme operator/acquirer, as
before.
In general, there are then two options: first, and somewhat unsatisfactorily, the
customer scans the code, validates the merchant name and then inputs a transaction
value – which then notifies the merchant, along with transaction status. If all is well,
the merchant hands the goods to the customer; otherwise a dispute arises. The second
option is to use a dynamic QR code, which necessitates the merchant having either
a smartphone or a POS device capable of displaying QR codes. In this case, the
merchant enters transaction details into their device, which generates a QR code that
incorporates the transaction value as well as the details of the merchant. After scanning
the code, the customer reviews the details, and approves payment, and the transaction
is then forwarded to the scheme operator/acquirer, as before.
The most prominent examples of QR code payments are AliPay and WeChat Pay.
However, these are effectively closed loop payments, with all transactions taking place
English: Grade 12

45

inside the walled garden of the scheme; a similar approach has been taken by bKash
in Bangladesh.
A more open loop approach has been implemented in Singapore, where a series of
initiatives have resulted in the development of a national QR code payment service
based on bank and nonbank DFS accounts. In contrast, the international card payment
schemes Visa and Mastercard have launched multiple services around the word linking
QR code payments to debit and credit card accounts.
QR Codes – International Card Schemes
In the wake of the publication of the EMVCo standard, both Visa and Mastercard
launched QR code-based payment services in 2017 with a focus on emerging
economies. Both Visa and Mastercard are focusing on merchant presented QR codes,
whether static or dynamic; where the code is static, the customer is required to enter
the transaction amount. The transaction is secured using their card PIN.
Visa and Mastercard have deployed their services in several countries, including India,
Pakistan, Kenya, Nigeria (in partnership with Interswitch), Cambodia, Egypt, Ghana,
Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Malaysia, Pakistan, Rwanda, Tanzania, Thailand, Uganda and
Vietnam. Visa’s service is branded as mVisa QR, and Mastercard’s as Masterpass QR.
In general, these services are only relevant to banked customers who also have an
eligible Visa/Mastercard debit or credit card. It is also a requirement that their bank
has enrolled in the scheme, as it needs to be integrated into their mobile banking app.
To use the service, customers download their bank’s mobile banking app onto their
smartphone and personalize it with their account details. There is no requirement for
specific enrolment to use QR codes.
However, the standards themselves can be used outside the realms of the international
payment schemes – one example being EcoCash in Zimbabwe, which uses the
Masterpass QR standard in the operation of the EcoCash Scan & Pay service.
QR based payment scheme
Any QR code-based payment scheme needs a scheme operator, responsible for scheme
branding at acceptance points, defining the scheme rules and providing a mechanism
for handling disputes and exceptions.
In addition, the scheme operator must provide a mechanism for acquiring and settling
transactions; this can vary substantially, from the walled gardens of WeChat Pay and
AliPay, to the acquiring services provided by the card payment schemes and their
member banks, to the open, push payments developed in Singapore. The scheme
operator is responsible for either operating such a service on behalf of the scheme, or
securing cost-effective, reliable and enduring access to one for use by the scheme’s
participants.
QR code payments security
Security concerns have often been raised around QR code payments. There is little
46

English: Grade 12

security around the codes as currently used; a static code displayed by a merchant
could easily be attacked by an unscrupulous criminal sticking their own code over the
merchant’s code, which might not be noticed. The primary defense against this attack
is the use of merchant IDs, registration and real-time notification of payment. Scanning
the code simply retrieves the merchant ID, for submission to the scheme/acquirer for
payment. An attacker would need to have a valid merchant ID to which payments
could be diverted for this attack to be successful, and the merchant onboarding process
would provide sufficient information for the criminal to be identified. If a customer
made a payment, but the merchant did not receive notification, then the merchant
would not hand over the goods and an investigation would be initiated to see where the
customer’s funds had gone – leading directly to the criminal.
But this is a time consuming and expensive process (in a busy shop with frequent low
value transactions the lack of a notification might not be noticed), and it would be
better to stop the fraud happening in the first place rather than trying to correct it later.
The first line of defense should be the customer; if the app displayed the merchant’s
name (the “trading as” name, not the company name), the customer could check that
it was correct. This could be part of more robust protection, achieved through the use
of a digital signature, so that the merchant ID and merchant name are authenticated
by the mobile banking app as well as the customer before the payment is made; in
this way, the app can be sure that the merchant name is correct, that the QR code was
issued by the scheme, and hasn’t been faked (the same approach can be used to secure
dynamic QR codes, by using the signed merchant ID and merchant name, and leaving
the transaction value unsigned).

Read the following text about laughter and human behaviour and do the given
tasks.
My conversation with Sophie Scott is nearly over when she spins round in her chair
to show me a video of a near-naked man cannon balling into a frozen swimming pool.
After a minute of flexing his muscles rather dramatically, he makes the jump – only to
smash and tumble across the unbroken ice. The water may have remained solid, but it
doesn’t take long for his friends to crack up.
“They start laughing as soon as they see there isn’t blood and bones everywhere,” says
Scott. “And they are SCREAMING with mirth; it’s absolutely helpless.”
Why do we get such an attack of the giggles – even when someone is in pain? And why
is it so contagious? As a neuroscientist at University College London, Scott has spent
the last few years trying to answer these questions – and at TED 2015 in Vancouver last
week, she explained why laughter is one of our most important, and misunderstood,
behaviours.
Scott’s work has not always met the approval of her straight-laced colleagues. She
likes to point out a handwritten note she once found stuck to the top of her printouts.
“This pile of paper seems like rubbish (because of the nature of the material) and will
be disposed of if not collected,” the note read. “Is this science?” In an ironic nod to the
criticisms, Scott is now wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the question, ready for a
comedy gig she is hosting later in the evening.
She started out her career by examining the voice more generally, and the rich
information it offers about our identity. “You can get a good shot at my gender, my
English: Grade 12

53

age, my socioeconomic status, my geographical origins, my mood, my health, and
even things to do with interactions,” she says.
One of her experiments involved scanning professional impersonator Duncan Wisbey
to explore the way that he comes to adopt the subtle mannerisms of other people’s
speech. Surprisingly, she found that the brain activity seemed to reflect areas normally
associated with bodily motion and visualisation – as he, almost literally, tried to work
his way under the skin of a character. More generally, the work on impersonations
has helped her pin down the regions involved in things like accent and articulation –
important aspects of our vocal identity.
But it was a study in Namibia that
made Scott begin to realise laughter
is one of our richest vocal tics.
Previous research had shown that
we can all recognise six universal
emotions across cultures – fear, anger,
surprise, disgust, sadness, happiness
– based on facial expressions. Scott,
however, wanted to see if we encode
more subtle information in our voice.
So she asked indigenous Namibians
and English people to listen to
recordings of each other and rate the
emotions represented – including the
six accepted universals, as well as
relief, triumph, or contentment.
Laughter was the most easily recognisable emotion across both groups. “Almost
immediately, it started to look different from the other positive emotions,” she
says.
The more she probed, the more she became fascinated by its intricacies. For
instance, she soon found out that the vast majority of laughs have nothing to do
with humour. “People genuinely think they are mostly laughing at other people’s
jokes, but within a conversation, the person who laughs most at any one time is
the person who is talking,” she says. Instead, she now sees laughter as a “social
emotion” that brings us together and helps us to bond, whether or not something is
actually funny. “When you laugh with people, you show them that you like them,
you agree with them, or that you are in same group as them,” she says. “Laughter
is an index of the strength of a relationship.”
Infectious giggles
That might explain why couples can roll about laughing at each other’s apparent wit
– while onlookers fail to be infected. “You’ll hear someone say ‘he’s got a great sense
54

English: Grade 12

of humour and I really fancy him because of it’. What you mean is ‘I fancy him and I
show him I like him by laughing when I’m around him.’”
Indeed, mirth might be the primary way of maintaining relationships; she points to
research, for instance, showing that couples who laugh with each other find it much
easier to dissipate tension after a stressful event – and overall, they are likely to stay
together for longer. Other recent studies have shown that people who laugh together at
funny videos are also more likely to open up about personal information – paving more
common ground between people.
Even the hilarity at the German man falling in the frozen swimming pool may have
united the friends. “It’s interesting how quickly his friends start laughing – I think it’s
to make him feel better,” says Scott. Along these lines, Robin Dunbar at the University
of Oxford has found that laughter correlates with increased pain threshold, perhaps
by encouraging the release of endorphins – chemicals that should also improve social
bonding.
Scott is now interested in picking apart the differences between the “posed” giggles
we might use to pepper our conversation – and the absolutely involuntary fits that can
destroy a TV or radio broadcast, like this:
For instance, she found that the less authentic tones are often more nasal – whereas
our helpless, involuntary belly laughs never come through the nose. Her MRI scans,
meanwhile, have looked at the way the brain responds to each kind of laughter.
Both seem to tickle the brain’s mirror regions – the areas that tend to mimic other’s
actions. These areas will light up whether I see you kicking a ball, or if I kick it
myself, for instance – and it could be this neural mimicry that makes laughter so
contagious. “You are 30 times more likely to laugh if you’re with someone else,”
she says. An important difference, however, is that the less spontaneous, social
laughs, tend to trigger greater activity in areas associated with “mentalising” and
working out other people’s motives – perhaps because we want to understand why
they are faking it.
You may think it is easy to tell the difference between involuntary and more artificial
laughs, but Scott thinks the skill develops slowly across the lifespan and may not peak
until our late 30s. For this reason, she has recently set up an experiment at London’s
Science Museum, where her team will be asking visitors of different ages to judge the
authenticity of different clips of people laughing and crying. After all, she points out
that crying is an infant’s primary way of communicating, whereas laughter gains more
importance the older we get.
Although we may tend to dislike certain people’s “fake” laughs, Scott thinks it
probably says more about us, and the way we are responding to their social signals,
than anything particularly irritating about them. She tells me about an acquaintance
who had frequently irritated her with a persistent, fluting, laugh. “I always thought
that she laughed so inappropriately, but when I paid more attention to it I saw that
English: Grade 12

55

what was odd was simply the fact I didn’t join in. Her laughter was entirely normal.”
If she hadn’t disliked the person already, she says, she would have laughed away and
wouldn’t have even noticed.
Why not listen to some of Scott's clips and judge your own abilities to read people’s
laughter:
Besides probing the bonds in our closest relationships, Scott’s curiosity has also
taken her to comedy clubs. “What’s interesting about laughter in the situation of
stand-up is that it’s still an interaction,” she says. In a way, the audience is having a
conversation with the comedian. “I’m interested in what happens when the audience
starts laughing and how it dies away – whether are you in sync with people around
you or whether you don’t care, because the experience is just between you and the
person on the stage.”
Paradoxically, she says, comedians often find it easier to work in large venues,
perhaps because the contagious nature of laughter means that waves of mirth can
catch on more easily when there are more people. She recalls a video of comedian
Sean Lock reducing the audience to fits of hysterics simply by saying the word
“cummerbund” occasionally, thanks to the infectious laughter spreading through
the audience.
So far, she has tried to equip audience members watching comedians with sensors
to track the outbreak of laughter, with limited success – the audience froze under the
attention. But she hopes to continue the work with a high-profile comedian like Rob
Delaney, who may be able to break through the awkwardness.
Scott occasionally takes up the microphone herself at comedy nights in London, and
I ask her if her insights have fed her stage persona? She disagrees that science has
offered her a fast track to comic genius, though as I discover at a charity gig the
following evening, she is very funny.
As her “Is this science?” T-shirt reminds us, her more uptight colleagues might
disapprove of her flippant attitude – but then, Scott understands just how powerful
a tool that laughter can be to express ourselves, and get people to listen. “Laughter
seems trivial, ephemeral, pointless,” she says. “But it is never neutral – there’s always
a meaning to it.”

Three nights a week, the residents of our neighborhood in Yokohama deposit their
household trash at specified areas on the street corners. It's wrapped in neat bundles, it
looks like gifts, and it disappears at dawn. For two or three nights near the end of each
month, they bring out the sodaigomi. These are articles no longer wanted around the
house and too big for normal trash collection. Big garbage can really be big: I've seen
sofas, refrigerators, bookcases, chairs, bed frames, vacuum cleaners, and an acetylene
welding tank, a motorcycle, and numerous television sets.
Sodaigomi exists for two reasons. One is the small size of the typical Japanese house,
with its lack of attic, cellar, garage, or spare room. When a new TV comes in, the old
one must go out. (This also applies to cars. To buy a new one, you have to prove to the
government that you have a place to park it, which for most people means getting rid
English: Grade 12

61

of the old car. I can’t figure out what happens to the old cars: they're certainly not on
the roads, and so far I haven't seen one in a sodaigomi pile.)
The other reason is the Japanese desire for freshness and purity. No one here really
enjoys using something that has passed through on other people's hands. My Japanese
friends seem to feel about buying a second hand radio, lamp, or table the way I'd feel
about buying someone else’s socks. There is a "recycle shop" in our neighborhood
that sells used clothes and toys at cut rates. Presumably someone must buy there, since
in business, but usually shoppers seem to scoot by in embarrassment, as if it were
a Frederick’s of Hollywood shop. Whenever I'm listening to the Far East Network,
the U.S. military's radio station, and hear at a garage sale, I realize that the American
soldiers are unusual not just because they have garages but also because they can sell
their old possession rather than throw them out.
Our first sodaigomi night came shortly after we moved into our current house. It cut
into our hearts in a way none of our neighbors could own. For one thing, we had
no furniture, silverware, or other whole belongings, because everything except the
clothes in our suite was making a five-week sea journey up from our last house, in
Malaysia. We had also just come from a culture with a wholly different approach to
used goods. Malaysia is a land of tropical abundance, but no one throws anything
away. Just before leaving we had auctioned off every spare item in the house, from
frying pans and mosquito nets to half-used rolls of Scotch tape. Several customers were
enthusiastically bidding for the shirts my sons had on. It was painful to go from that
world to one in which we didn't have any household goods, couldn't bring ourselves to
buy the overpriced new ones in the store - and then saw heaps of clean, new-looking
merchandise just sitting on the street.
You can see where I am leading. It was not in us to resist. We had quickly tired of eating,
sitting, relaxing, studying, and performing all other indoor activities on the floor, without tables
or chairs, while waiting for our ship to come in. "Set the floor, please, boys," my wife would call
at dinner time. I lay sprawled on my stomach in front of my computer keyboard, attempting to
type while resting my weight on my elbows, trying to cheer myself with mental images of Abe
Lincoln sprawled before the fire as a boy. Then one evening, as we trudged home at twilight
from the train station, we saw two replenished-looking sodaigomi piles. In one, was a perfectly
nice plastic lawn chair and in the other, an ordinary low Japanese tea table. You couldn't use both
of these at the same time - if you sat in the lawn chair, you'd be too high to reach down to the
table comfortably. But if we had the table, we could at least eat without bending over to reach
plates, of food on the floor, which made me feel like a husky eating its chow.
We were in a crowd, of course, when we first saw the sodaigomi. We were too confused
and timid to grab anything from the pile just then. But that night I sat in our kitchen,
peering through our window toward the sodaigomi at the end of the street. The door
62

English: Grade 12

to ajuku, or cram school, was near the piles. The last group of teenage students left
there around eleven. After midnight the trains from Tokyo become much less frequent:
I could depend on intervals of fifteen or twenty minutes between clumps of salarymen
teetering drunkenly from the station toward home. The street looked bare at 12:30, so
I made my move. The next morning we placed our breakfast dishes on our table, and I
read the morning paper while luxuriating in my full-length lawn chair.
It was two more days before the sodaigomi collectors came. In those two nights, we laid in
as many provisions as we decently could. A shiny new bell for one son's bicycle, a small
but attractive wooden cupboard, a complete set of wrenches and screwdrivers in a metal
toolbox, a Naugahyde-covered barstool, a lacquer serving tray. If I didn't already know
English I would probably have taken the four large boxes containing dozen tape cassettes
from the Advanced Conversational English series. My son walked in the door one day, said
“Guess what?" and presented black-and-white TV. In self-defense, I should point out that
everything except a few rusty wrenches looked perfectly clean, whole, and serviceable. In
any other culture you'd never believe these things were being thrown out.
That was last summer; we've learned a lot since then. We realize that sodaigomi is
part of a larger cycle, in which it's important to give as well as receive. So, when our
household shipment arrived, we gave the lawn chair back to the pile- and later we
bought a new color TV and gave back the black-and-white one. We've learned that
we're not alone in our secret practice. Last month, I met an American writer who lives
on the outskirts of Tokyo. I admired the leather notebook he was carrying and asked
him where he got it. "You'll never believe this ...," he said. We've learned that some
Japanese, too, overcome their squeamishness about secondhand material. When I'm up
late at night, I sometimes catch a glimpse of the sodaigomi area - a more disinterested
glimpse, now that our house is furnished - and see a van cruising back and forth,
checking it out. In the morning, the choicest items are gone.
And I've learned where I'll draw the line. As the only foreigners in our neighborhood,
we are laughably conspicuous. People must know that we're skimming the sodaigomi,
but if we do our best to be discreet about it, operating in the dead of night, everyone
can pretend not to notice and we bring no shame upon our kind. Late one night, on the
way home from the train station, I saw two handsome wooden bookcases sitting by a
lamppost. I thought of the books piled on our floor, I looked around me quickly, and I
happily picked up one bookcase with both arms.
It was fifteen minutes before I could get back for the other - only to find that it wasn't
there. Twenty yards down the street I saw a hunch shuffling figure. An old wino in a
filthy overcoat, with a crippled left leg, was laboriously dragging the bookcase away
toward his lair. Within seconds, I was heading home again, looking as if I'd never
dreamt of wrest ... a bum for a bookcase. But, I know what first flashed through my
mind when I saw my treasure disappear: "I can take this guy!"

Living in a Redwood Tree
Before you read

What would you like to do to contribute to the protection of the environment in
your area? How much time can you spend in doing so?
Do you know what Julia Butterfly Hill did to save the redwood forest in
California?

Read the following text about Julia Butterfly Hill’s sacrifice to save the redwood
trees and do the given tasks.
Imagine living in a 200-ft-tall redwood tree for more than two years. Twenty years
ago, Julia Butterfly Hill did just that, to draw attention to the continued clearcutting of
California’s remaining redwood forests.
Hill did not set foot on the earth for 738 days. Instead, she learned to climb up and
down the 1000-year-old redwood tree for exercise. She found she felt safer to climb
barefoot, without climbing gear. Her feet developed muscles she hadn’t known they
possessed.
She was cold and wet for much of that two years. There was no heat, no electricity. No
artificial light. She had a sleeping bag, a solar-powered cell phone for media interviews,
and a single-burner propane stove to cook and heat water. She had few necessities, and
no luxuries.
Hill lived on two platforms, built from wood scraps and covered with tarps to
theoretically keep the rain out. One measured 6 ft. by 8 ft. The smaller one, 4 ft. by 8
ft., was mostly used for storage.
She had occasional visitors – fellow tree-sitters staying over or bringing supplies, and
other visitors including a couple of celebrities, as well as spiders, birds, and mice.
A pair of resident flying squirrels specialized in keeping her awake at night by noisily
investigating all her supplies.
Why, you might wonder, would anyone stay in a tree so long?
English: Grade 12

69

Hill had survived a bad car accident in Arkansas in 1996. It took a year of therapy
for her short-term memory and motor skills to return. She said the experience was a
wake-up call. Until then, her main focus had been work. “It became clear to me that
our value as people is not in our stock portfolios and bank accounts, but in the legacies
we leave behind.”
When she recovered, she resolved to travel and visit spiritual sites around the world.
But first her neighbors invited her to join them on a driving trip to the West Coast. A
stranger they met in passing told them they had to see the redwoods in California.
On arriving in the redwood forest, Hill says, “Gripped by the spirit of the forest, I
dropped to my knees and began to sob… Surrounded by these huge, ancient giants, I
felt the film covering my senses from the imbalance of our fast-paced, technologically
dependent society melt away.
“I could feel my whole being bursting forth into new life in this majestic cathedral. I
sat and cried for a long time. Finally, the tears turned into joy and the joy turned into
mirth, and I sat and laughed at the beauty of it all.”
Even though Hill had just begun her travels, she felt called to try to protect the remaining
majestic redwoods. Less than three per cent of the original forests were still standing,
yet the logging continued.
At first Hill was unsure whether to trust this new calling. So she prayed to the Universal
Spirit for guidance: “If I’m truly meant to come back and fight for these forests out
here, please help me know what I’m meant to do, and use me as a vessel.” Soon, she
found herself feeling at peace with the plan to stay, and received a sign she saw as the
Universe’s approval.
Hill learned the logging was detrimental to people, as well as the forest. A hillside
near Stafford, CA, had already been clear-cut. Just months before Hill arrived, a huge
20-ft-high mudslide carried trees, stumps and debris from that hillside down into the
town, leaving seven families without homes. Despite evidence that clearcutting had
destabilized the hillside and caused the mudslide, the Department of Forestry granted
permission to continue logging on the very next slope.
That slope was where the tree which became known as Luna stood. The redwood was
marked for destruction with a slash of blue paint. A group of activists had established a
tree-sit, but were having trouble finding people to stay in it. The weather was getting colder.
Base camp was being dismantled in preparation to end the protest for the winter. “I need
somebody to commit for a long period of time,” the organizer told Hill. “At least five days.”
Hill did two five or six-day stints in the tree. But knowing Luna could be cut down as
soon as the tree-sitters left, she wanted to do more. By staying longer, Hill felt, she could
continue to draw attention to the plight of the redwood forests, and keep pressure on the
logging company to change its plans and allow Luna and the surrounding grove to live.
Although the other activists were divided on whether or not to support her, five people
70

English: Grade 12

promised to keep Hill supplied with food and necessities. She went up the tree on
December 10, 1997. No one imagined how long Hill would end up staying in Luna,
nor the trials she might have to endure.
Early on, the logging company resolved to starve her out or drive her away. They
hired 24-hour security guards to harass her and to ensure her support team couldn’t
deliver her supplies. She was menaced with a helicopter at a dangerously close range.
A neighboring tree was felled, hitting Luna’s outer branches and nearly causing Hill
to fall. She was verbally abused, threatened with violence, rape and death, kept awake
with floodlights, and bugles and air horns were blown through the night.
She began to hate the loggers, and even to hate herself, because she was part of the
same human race that had so little respect for Nature. But knowing that hatred was part
of the same violence she was trying to work against, Hill spent time praying for help.
One day after praying, she felt filled with love. She realized what she was feeling was
the love of the Earth, the love of Creation: “Every day we, as a species, do so much to
destroy Creation’s ability to give us life. But that Creation continues to do everything
in its power to give us life anyway. And that’s true love,” she realized.
If Creation could do that for us, Hill decided, then she had to find within herself
unconditional love even for the loggers. She began to talk to them as fellow humans,
responding to abuse with songs or conversational questions.
A few weeks later it was New Year’s Eve, a time for resolutions. “Resolution is about
resolve,” she thought. “My resolution… was to take a stand like the redwood tree, and
not back down. Even after they’ve been chopped into the ground, redwoods don’t give
up,” she said. “Instead they try to sprout new life.”
The months ahead held great challenges for Hill. The logging company wasn’t her
only problem. One of her scariest times was a 16-hour, 70-mph windstorm, one of
the worst Northern California storms in decades. The wind shredded the tarps that
surrounded her, and even ripped huge branches off the tree. “Sleet and hail sliced
through the tattered pieces of what used to be my roof and walls,” she wrote.
“Every new gust flipped the platform up into the air, threatening to hurl me over the
edge. I was scared. I take that back. I was terrified. As a child, I experienced a tornado.
But that was a walk in the park on a sunny Sunday afternoon compared to this.”
Clutching the branch that came through the middle of the platform, and so terrified
she was afraid she might lose her mind, Hill prayed to Luna for help. “In that moment,
I heard the voice of Luna speak to me. ‘Julia, think of the trees in the storm… They
allow themselves to bend and be blown with the wind. They understand the power of
letting go,” the voice told her.
That night, Hill felt she let go of her very self. When the storm departed, she no longer
feared death. She felt she had undergone a transformation, like the nickname she’d had
since childhood – Butterfly.

Many more experiences unfolded during those two years. Her feet once turned black
with painful frostbite. When lightning struck nearby during an electrical storm, her
hair stood straight up. Nearby helicopter logging made her ears ring for weeks. Then
for six days, the leftover stumps and debris were set on fire on the entire slope. Her
eyes swelled almost completely shut, and her throat and lungs burned from the thick
smoke that surrounded her.
Thankfully, Hill also had many wonderful experiences. Despite the scorn often heaped
on environmentalists, Good Housekeeping Magazine nominated Hill one of the most
admired women in America. Striking steelworkers told her she had inspired them.
Fifth and sixth-grade students from a school in Wisconsin corresponded with her, and
even took action on her advice to reuse paper in order to protect forests. Hundreds of
people wrote to thank her for bringing a spotlight to the issue of deforestation. She also
had the ongoing support of her committed team, who hiked in for two hours each way,
three times a week, to keep her supplied with food and necessities, sometimes having
to outwit security guards in order to deliver them.
Finally, an agreement was reached with the logging company, and on December 18,
1999, Hill climbed down to once again walk on the earth.
With their willingness to sacrifice comfort and safety in order to bring the world’s
attention to the last stands of California’s majestic redwood forests, Hill and her
fellow activists left an important legacy. They were successful in saving Luna and
some surrounding trees. Through their efforts, thousands more people learned about
deforestation and its many ill effects.
As role models, Hill and her team showed us how we too could resolve to help Mother
Nature, and follow through with long-term, committed action. Twenty years later, this
is still an inspiring book, well worth reading.

Presenting Yourself

a.

c.

Have you ever applied for a job?
What documents do you need while applying for a job?
Are you familiar with the terms: bio-data, resume, CV and personal profile? Do
you have any of them?

Read the following text about the skills in preparing your CV and do the given
tasks.
We’re going to devote a whole chapter to CVs (as we shall call them) because this is
the single most important document that you will ever compile relating to your career
development. You need to approach the compilation and maintenance of a CV as an
on-going, career-long task.
If you haven’t already got one in a good state, you need to make a start now. Do not
underestimate the amount of time and effort that this work will take. Remember that your
CV needs to be accurate and truthful. A prospective employer may need to verify your
statements regarding, for example, work permit status, qualifications and may need to
take a criminal record check (especially if the job involves working with children). False
statements made in job applications may invalidate any subsequent appointment. Don’t
risk it. Having said that, our aim here, is to help you in the best possible way.
English: Grade 12

Curriculum vitae is a Latin term that literally means ‘course of life’. In practice, it
is a document that sets out a whole host of your personal details, experience and
achievements as they relate to your working life. Your full CV should be a well set
out, up-to-date, thoroughly accurate and exhaustive data bank of all of these details,
although you may well shape slightly different versions of your CV for different
purposes.
You need a good CV when applying for jobs, seeking promotion and trying to get
research funding. In addition, you will need to draw information from your CV for
things such as when you’re asked to be an external examiner for a course or a research
thesis; for audits of teaching and research activity; if your faculty or department has to
be validated by an external professional body – in short, any circumstances in which
somebody needs to judge your individual professional competence or that of you and
your colleagues collectively.
Compiling your CV also provides you with a crucially important opportunity to reflect
on and plan further developments in your career. What’s more, for those moments
of self-doubt about just how good you are, a well set out CV that demonstrates real
achievements can be very reassuring (and contrariwise, it might make you buck your
ideas up and get on with things).
When reflecting on your CV and how you need to develop it, think about whether
it is what Rebecca’s PhD supervisor called a ‘staying’ or a ‘leaving’ CV. A ‘staying
CV’ is that of the good university citizen, including plenty of committee work and
administration, pastoral care of students, a heavy teaching load as well as a credible
research record. A ‘leaving CV’ will reflect the interests of a prospective new employer
and will probably highlight research achievements, while still showing that you are
generally competent and willing across the range of duties undertaken by academics.
You should never place yourself in the position where your CV won’t allow you to
leave.
Graínne is planning well ahead. However, planning to move is not the only reason why
you need a leaving CV. Always remember that your current circumstances may change
rapidly and without much warning – you might get an obnoxious new dean who makes
your life a misery, or you might be made redundant. Never, ever thoroughly nail your
colours to a single university mast – the ship might sink at any moment. Also remember
that you don’t necessarily know when your
perfect, dream job is going to come up. If you
have a staying CV when it does, then you won’t
be in the best possible position to grab it.
It follows from what we’ve said above that,
because a CV is an important career planning
tool and you may need one in a hurry when that
perfect job comes up, it is never too early to put
80

English: Grade 12

your CV together. Don’t be put off starting because you have comparatively little to
put in it. Starting now will encourage good work practices, help you establish a good
basic framework and ensure that all your on-going work activities are recorded and
not forgotten.
Preparing and maintaining your CV has to be a collaborative, interactive and iterative
process. You need to enlist the help of your friends, family, mentors and more
experienced colleagues because it is a rare gift to be able to see ourselves as others see
us.
Later in this chapter we set out what we think is a pretty good CV pro-forma that you
might like to use as the basic framework for your own. Using a framework helps to
structure your recollections and thinking. Most people find constructing a CV using
this type of framework quite an affirming experience – they start off thinking they’ve
achieved very little or nothing but as they start to fill in the boxes they find that they’ve
actually done quite a lot.
You should show your draft CV to people who know you and/or who know what an
academic CV should look like and ask for feedback. Typically, they will remind you
of things you’ve done or skills you have demonstrated that you have overlooked or
underplayed. They will also help you with layout, prioritisation and emphasis. This
can be a fairly lengthy iterative process. Once you have done this basic spadework,
keeping your CV up-to-date should be relatively easy and a far less time consuming
task.
You must update your CV regularly, and little and often is best. Some people pop things
into their CVs as soon as they occur – for example, a paper accepted for publication.
Others keep a running note, perhaps in the back of their diary or a list on their notice
board, of things to add. Yet others update it with great regularity on the same day each
month and set up their computer to prompt them to do this. You need to adopt a system
that works for you. Whatever your system, you must:
a.
Have a system whereby details that need to be included on your CV do not get
lost or forgotten – something that can happen all too often.
b.
Regularly revise your CV to reflect major new developments in your work. For
instance, you might move into a distinctly new theoretical area.
c.
Revise your CV for current accuracy. For instance, you might have put down a
project that you were seeking funding for and it has not come to fruition or has
petered out. Equally, you might have a book or a paper down as ‘forthcoming’
for which you now have the full publication details.
Your CV should look like a bone-china display cabinet – the best pieces should always
be highlighted, your collection should be as complete as possible, and everything
should be clean and shiny.
As we have said above, you will compile different CVs for different purposes. What
English: Grade 12

81

we’re going to talk about here is your ‘full CV’, the data bank from which you might
compile shorter CVs for things like research funding applications or adapt for particular
job/promotion applications.
There are many employment or re-employment agencies in many countries whose
consultants specialise in helping people prepare their CVs. Their advice, and that
given generally to people in non-academic public sector or commercial jobs, is that a
CV should be exactly two pages long and should be accompanied by a very brief cover
letter. This is the antithesis of an academic CV, which is a species all of its own. It is
absolutely imperative that you understand this and resist all pressure to make your full
CV the more common two-page summary. This is one of the most important things we
have to tell you about academic CVs.
There are two key differences between academic and non-academic CVs. One is that
academic CVs tend to be quite a bit longer than those of non-academics, and they get
longer as a person’s career develops. Between twenty and thirty pages would not be
unusual for a well-established professor, although someone in a much more junior post
might quite rightly be expected to have only three or four pages. A second, and perhaps
more fundamental, difference is that non-academics, especially when they are seeking
middle management positions, are frequently encouraged to make largely unverifiable
assertions about their qualities and skills rather than to list verifiable achievements.
In contrast, academic CVs should never make vague or unsubstantiated assertions, for
two reasons. First, it is an inherent part of academic life and training that we look for
the verification of truth claims. Proving or justifying what we have said is part of our
culture. All the claims we seek to make in our research and teaching work need to be
backed up by some sort of evidence. Second, much of our work and what we achieve
is done via substantial public events, for instance, the winning of a research grant, the
publication of papers, conference presentations and so on.

On Walking
Before you read

b.

What is your best hobby?
How do you fulfil your hobby?

Now read the following text about the advantages of walking and do the given
tasks.
Walking has always been one of my favorite activities. To me it is the beginning of travel.
The movement, the rhythm, the undulation of the senses and of the body that it initiates- I
enjoy the very physical sensation of walking. When I was younger, I used to love proving
how quickly and untiringly I could walk for long distances. I especially loved walking
on roads that were unpaved and uneven, like the paths around my mamaghar. But back
then, it was easy enough to find paths like that even in Kathmandu. Some of my most
vivid memories involve running down the slopes behind my house. You would begin by
taking the smallest steps to balance yourself, then without even realizing it you would have
broken into a run until you completely lost control over your body. You would reach the
bottom in such a state of thrill. I’m sure it can never be replicated, even by a ride on the
most beautiful and sophisticated roller-coaster.
As I grew older my adventures took on different shades and nuances. Walking became
a more social activity. In my teens, I began walking home from school with my friends.
Mostly we walked when we had stayed back for some after-school activity and the
buses had left, so it served as a sort of minor rebellion. Staying back after school in
itself made us feel grown-up, but it was our decision to take the long route home that
made it seem like a protest. During those walks, rebels against our regimented routine,
we could be free-willed masters of our time. We wanted to find our own way-so we’d
take shortcuts.
When I left school, my life changed drastically as I moved to a different country.
And there again I walked as a way of exploring this new world. On hot summer days
when the temperature climbed to forty degrees, I would walk leisurely, from school
88

English: Grade 12

to home, this time alone. Sometimes I’d walk along a quiet residential street, with
fences creeping with jasmine vines, until I reached the main road with the funny set
of shops: A wedding-cake shop; a rather dilapidated second-hand clothes shop that
at one time must have had ambitions of being something more glamorous; a barber
shop. Institutions once, they had slowly begun to lose their sheen and were on their
way to being replaced by fancier stores and boutiques. On other days I’d walk down
the more exciting Norton Street lined with cafes and restaurants, and later a beautiful
mall designed in imitation of an Italian piazza. Though these walks were more an
expression of listlessness and confusion than conscious design, they helped me to
navigate not only the place where I was to spend the next few years of my life, but also
the renewed circumstances of my life and the changes that would inevitably stamp
themselves on my psyche. Amid all kinds of pressures I felt to fit in and adapt, walking
was both an escape and a search for a pace and a rhythm that felt most natural to me.
Australian streets were far quieter
and organized when compared to the
cacophonous streets of Kathmandu. Yet
in time, I grew to love the solitude they
offered. Across the big Parramatta Road
from Leichhardt, where the buildings of
my high school stood, was the completely
nondescript Petersham, where I lived with
my family on a street that faced the dreary
backsides of shops along Parramatta Road.
Dismal as it was, it had its treasures. A tiny
park no one visited was a minute down the
road, and once you turned the corner to another park, with a huge rock at one end.
Perhaps it didn’t offer much in terms of access or glamour, but it was a good place
between the harsh and noisy highway and the more comfortable. It was a good
place to hide, a buffer zone suburb. As I walked uphill towards the train station the
street seemed to dip into the horizon and suddenly come to an end it made quite a
sight at twilight, against the backdrop of a darkening blue sky.
I walked the streets of Sydney in the cool morning, the blistering noon, at sunset,
and even at dawn, on my way home from certain unforgotten night outs that lie
listlessly in the trunk of my memory with no obvious purpose. I frequently walked
for an hour along Parramatta road to get to Sydney University. The sights I found
there were so different from those I had once been accustomed to, but slowly they
took the place of the familiar and my birthplace became a memory, too far and too
distant to have a distinct shape. And along this long, seemingly irreversible and
frequently disturbing journey only a few things remained constant: the earth and
the sky, the trees, water. For a long time in this journey they really were my only
English: Grade 12

89

friends and companions, the only entities with whom I would share the secrets of
my heart. Or was it rather the painful lack of secrets because it had been emptied
of everything it had once known and loved? Walking became a conversation I
had with the world—the physical world around me and the natural world that
peeked from beneath paved roads and behind skyscrapers. It was my body’s way
of reminding itself of its naturalness and beauty when the mind had become home
to doubts and distress.
Even though culturally my journey had been westwards, towards those places
that people generally associate with material wealth and comfort, I felt that I had
journeyed to a desert, to emptiness, where there was no footing to be had, and
walking was perhaps the healthiest way to seek that lost footing. The further I
moved from the tumult of my hometown, the more solitary my walks became. In
the last years before I returned to Kathmandu, I was in the United States with a
definite purpose: To get a degree. Unlike the previous transitions in my life, I had
chosen this one myself. But simply because you make an intentional decision does
not mean that everything that follows conforms to your designs or expectations.
The years I spent in Minneapolis were perhaps the most solitary of my life:
Solitary in the sense that through experiences so new and unexpected that I barely
had language to understand them, let alone communicate them with someone. I
took long walks there. In retrospect I feel like walking became life: Solitary in
the sense that I went unexpected that I barely had communication with someone
almost an achievement in itself as the ostensible purpose for what had ended up
there dwindled away. I lived and walked in neighborhoods that were beautiful for
their sloping streets and proximity to water in a city mostly flat except when it had
risen to cup one of its hundred lakes. There was snow on the ground for almost
half of the year. As soon as the snow began to melt I broke in a new pair of shoes
accompany me on my walks. On Sundays, when I left for my walk rather early in
the morning there’d be hardly anyone on the streets. And the beautiful buildings
that had been erected few centuries ago in service of trade along the Mississippi
river seemed to lie waste or awaiting a revival. Sometimes a deer that had lost its
way would be grazing in the middle of the park by the river. This was during spring
and autumn. During the frigid winters I walked on a treadmill on the top floor of
my apartment building gazing that the pale blue sky and the eagles that flew in
circles repeatedly.
Even though I was a stranger to that city and I never stopped feeling a sense of hesitation
before walking into the doors of its buildings and houses, I felt as if the place itself
was known to me. I wondered about the people who had lived here before the city was
built and felt that their spirits were still around in the weeds that grew in the shallow
end of the lake, and in the old trees that had been left undisturbed for centuries. Every
time I was driven along highways and saw the vast uninhabited tracts of land beside it,
90

English: Grade 12

I was reminded that like every other place on earth this place too is ancient, with the
shape and texture of the land bearing witness to its age. In that sense, how far could I
really be from home? My head hurt to think of options and possibilities I’d inevitably
have to weigh once I left but my body had made itself at home there, like everywhere
else I had lived.
Our world is so populated with brilliant and imaginative ideas, beautiful songs, things
to look at, things to be in awe of and to revere, beauty and pleasure in all forms and
guises, that we often forget that the layers of beauty we perceive in our everyday
lives are built on something not of our making--this earth, and beyond it space, of
which it is a part. Walking makes us aware obliquely- of space, of that invisible and
intangible thing without which no object can exist, cohere and have meaning. The
space between two footsteps makes it possible for us to move, and as we walk, even
when we are keeping step on with ourselves, a million others walk with us, maintaining
the imperceptible relationship with space, which is governed by laws which we only
have the minutest clue about.
I have always known, since the first time I left home, that I’d love every place I’d visit,
maybe not the people, or the culture, but itself the trees, the way the land meets the
sky, the life it leads beneath the quotidian, its inhabitants and to which whether we are
aware of it or not, inextricably and fundamentally bound. Walking brought me close
places, made me notice the things around me, bound me to the places that became my
home because ultimately no matter where I went the air that brushed against me and
the light that poured into my eyes each morning, the sounds of birds and insects, or
machines were the same everywhere. It may sound ironic but walking kept me close to
my roots and gave me a sense of grounding, because no matter which part of the world
I happened to be in, when I walked, I was my intrinsic self.
Now, back home again, as I walk the streets of my beloved hometown, I am filled with
gratitude for all the streets that have given shape to my feet, my body and my being.

Bhim

: Yeah. Thanks. I must do
that. But remember to carry

Trishna : Sure. That sounds exciting!
Will you remind me how long the hiking to Ranimahal in Palpa is?
Bhim

: Not much. We can get there within a couple of hours from Tansen. I have
been there twice with my family.

Trishna : But, I have never been there.
Bhim

: You must hike to Ranimahal. Located by the side of the Kaligandaki River,
the palace is marvelous. It’s thrilling to walk on a path right above a raging
stream right before reaching Ranimahal. This monument is compared with
the Taj Mahal in India. Do you know who built it?

Trishna : Wow! Sounds Marvelous! I think Ranimahal was built by Khadga Shamsher
Junga Bahadur Rana in memory of Tej Kumari Devi, his youngest wife,
who died in 1892.

What do these pictures mean?

Now read the following text about the importance of interdependence at the
present time and do the given tasks.
We’ve never been as self-conscious about ourselves as we seem to be these days. The
popular magazines are filled with advice on things to do with a self: how to find it,
identify it, nurture it, protect it, and even, for special occasions, weekends, how to lose
it transiently. There are instructive books, best sellers on self-realization, self-help,
and self-development. Groups of self-respecting people pay large fees for three day
sessions together, learning self-awareness. Self-enlightenment can be taught in college
electives.
You’d think, to read about it, that we’d only just now discovered selves. Having long
suspected that there was something alive in there, winning the place, separate from
everyone else, absolutely individual and independent, we’ve celebrated by giving it a
real name.
Myself.
It is an interesting word, formed long ago in much more social ambiguity than you’d
expect. The original root was se or seu, simply the pronoun of the third person, and
most of the descendant words, except “self” itself, were constructed to allude to other,
somehow connected people; “sibs” and “gossips,” relatives and close acquaintances,
came from seu. Se was also used to indicate some side or apart, hence words like
“separate,” “secret”and “segregate.” From an extended root swedh it moved into Greek
meaning people of one’s own sort, and ethos, meaning the customs of such people.
English: Grade 12

97

“Ethics” means the behavior of people like one’s self, one’s own ethics.
We tend to think of ourselves as the only wholly unique in nature, but it is not so.
Uniqueness is so commonplace a property of living things that there is really nothing
at all unique about it. The phenomenon can’t be unique and universal at the same
time. Even individual, free-swimming bacteria can be viewed as unique entities
distinguishable from each other even when they are the progeny of a single clone.
Spudich and Koshland have recently reported that motile microorganisms of the same
species are like solitary eccentrics in their swimming behavior. When they are searching
for food, some tumble in one direction for precisely so many seconds before quitting,
while others tumble differently and for different, but characteristic, periods of time. If
you watch them closely, tethered by their flagellae to the surface of an antibody-coated
slide, you can tell them from each other by the way they twirl, as accurately as though
they had different names.
Beans carry self-labels, and are marked by these as distinctly as a mouse by his special
smell. The labels are glycoproteins, the lectins, and may have something to do with
negotiating the intimate and essential attachment between the bean and the nitrogenfixing bacteria which live as part of the plant’s flesh, embedded in root nodules. The
lectin from one line of legume has a special affinity for the surfaces of the particular
bacteria which colonize that line, but not for bacteria from other types of bean. The
system seems designed for the maintenance of exclusive partnerships. Nature is pieced
together by little snobberies like this.
Coral polyps are biologically self-conscious. If you place polyp of the same genetic
line together, touching each other, they will fuse and become a single polyp, but if the
lines are different, one will reject the other.
Fish can tell each other apart as individuals, by the smell of self. So can mice, and
here the olfactory discrimination is governed by the same H2 locus which contains the
genes for immunologic self-marking.
The only living units that seem to have no sense of privacy at all are the nucleated
cells that have been detached from the parent organism and isolated in a laboratory
dish. Given the opportunity, under the right conditions, two cells from wildly different
sources, a yeast cell, say, say, and a chicken erythrocyte, will touch, fuse, and the two
nuclei will then fuse as well, and the new hybrid cell will now divide into monstrous
progeny. Naked cells, lacking self-respect, do not seem to have any sense of self.
The markers of self, and the sensing mechanisms responsible for detecting such
markers, are conventionally regarded as mechanisms for maintaining individuality for
its own sake, enabling one kind of creature to defend and protect itself against all the
rest. Selfness, seen thus, is for self-preservation.
In real life, though, it doesn’t seem to work this way. The self-marking of invertebrate
animals in the sea, who must have perfected the business long before evolution got
98

English: Grade 12

around to us, was set up in order to permit creatures of one kind to locate others, not
for predation but to set up symbiotic households. The anemones who live on the shells
of crabs are precisely finicky; so are the crabs. Only a single species of anemone will
find its way to only a single species of crab. They sense each other exquisitely, and live
together as though made for each other.
Sometimes there is such a mix-up about selfness that two creatures, each attracted
by the molecular configuration of the other, incorporate the two selves to make
a single organism. The best story I’ve ever heard about this is the tale told of
the nudibranch and medusa living in the Bay of Naples. When first observed,
the nudibranch, a common sea slug, was found to have a tiny vestigial parasite,
in the form of a jellyfish, permanently affixed to the ventral surface near the
mouth. In curiosity to learn how the medusa got there, some marine biologists
began searching the local waters for earlier developmental forms, and discovered
something amazing. The attached parasite, although apparently so specialized as
to have given up living for itself, can still produce offspring, for they are found in
abundance at certain seasons of the year. They drift through the upper waters, grow
up nicely and astonishingly, and finally become full-grown, handsome, normal
jellyfish. Meanwhile, the snail produces snail larvae, and these too begin to grow
normally, but not for long. While still extremely small, they become entrapped in
the tentacles of the medusa and then engulfed within the umbrella-shaped body.
At first glance, you’d believe the medusae are now the predators, paying back for
earlier humiliations, and the snails the prey. But no. Soon the snails, undigested
and insatiable, begin to eat, browsing away first at the radial canals, then the
borders of the rim, finally the tentacles, until the jellyfish becomes reduced in
substance by being eaten while the snail grows correspondingly in size. At the end,
the arrangement is back to the first scene, with a full-grown nudibranch basking,
and nothing left of the jellyfish except the round, successfully edited parasite,
safely affixed to the skin near the mouth.
It is a confusing tale to sort out, and even more confusing to think about. Both creatures are
designed for this encounter, marked as selves so that they can find each other in the waters
of the Bay of Naples. The collaboration, if you want to call it that, is entirely specific; it is
only this species of medusa and only this kind of nude branch that can come together and
live this way. And, more surprising, they cannot live in any other way; they depend for their
survival on each other. They are not really selves, they are specific others.
What does the collaboration of the selves tell us about our identity?
The thought of these creatures gives me an odd feeling. They do not remind me of
anything, really. I’ve never heard of such a cycle before. They are bizarre, that’s it,
unique. And at the same time, like a vaguely remembered dream, they remind me of
the whole earth at once. I cannot get my mind to stay still and think it through.

After the World Trade Centre
Before you read
a.
b.

What do you see in the given pictures?
Have you heard/read about September 11, 2001 attack on the twin towers in the
USA? If yes, share your ideas to the class.

Read the following text about the effects of 9/11 on family and friends and do the
given tasks.
In 1999, soon after moving to the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn, my wife and I were
befriended by Frank and Nicole De Martini, a couple whose lives were closely twinned
with the towers of the World Trade Center. Both Frank and Nicole are architects. As
Construction Manager of the World Trade Center, Frank’s offices were on the 88th
floor of Tower 1. Nicole is an employee of the engineering firm that built the World
Trade Center, Leslie E. Robertson Associates. Hired as a “surveillance engineer”, she
was a member of a team that conducted year-round structural integrity inspections of
the twin towers. Her offices were on the 35th floor of Tower 2.
Frank is forty-nine, sturdily-built, with wavy salt-and-pepper hair and deeply-etched
laugh lines around his eyes. His manner is expansively avuncular and nothing pleases
him more than when the conversation turns to a subject on which he can offer his
expert advice. For Frank, the twin towers were both a livelihood and a passion: he
would speak of them with the absorbed fascination with which poets sometimes speak
of Dante’s canzones. Nicole is forty-two, blonde and blue-eyed, with a gaze that is
at once brisk and friendly. She was born in Basel, Switzerland, and met Frank while
studying ‘design’ in New York. They have two children, Sabrina, 10, and Dominic, 8,
who are unusually well-matched with mine, in age, gender and temperament: it was
through our children that we first met.
Frank and Nicole’s relationship with the World Trade Center was initiated by the
104

English: Grade 12

basement bomb explosion of 1993. Shortly afterwards, Frank was hired to do bomb
damage assessment. An assignment that he had thought would last only a few months,
turned quickly into a consuming passion. “He fell in love with the buildings,” Nicole
told me. “For him they represented an incredible human feat; he was awed by their
scale and magnitude, by the innovative design features, and by the efficiency of the use
of materials. One of his most-repeated sayings about the towers is that they were built
to take the impact of a light airplane.”
On the morning of Tuesday, September 11, 2001, Frank and Nicole dropped their
children off at their school, in Brooklyn Heights, and then drove on to the World Trade
Center. Traffic was light and they arrived unexpectedly early, so Nicole decided to go
up to Frank’s office for a quick cup of coffee. It was about a quarter past eight when
they reached Frank’s office. A half hour later, Nicole pushed back her chair and stood
up to go. She was on her way out the door, when the walls and the floor suddenly
heaved under the shock of a massive impact. Franks’ office commanded a panoramic
southwards view, looking towards the Statue of Liberty and the harbour. Now, through
the thick plates of glass, she saw a wave of flame bursting out overhead, like a torrent
spewing from the floodgates of a dam. The blast was clearly centered on the floor
directly above: she assumed that it was a bomb. Neither she nor Frank was unduly
alarmed: very few people knew the building’s strength and resilience better than they.
They assumed that the worst was over and the structure had absorbed the impact: it
was now a question of coping with the damage. Sure enough, within seconds of the
initial tumult, a sense of calm descended on their floor. Frank herded Nicole and a
group of some two dozen other people into a room that was relatively free of smoke.
Then, he went off to scout the escape routes and stairways. Minutes later he returned to
announce that he had found a stairway that was intact: they could reach it fairly easily,
by climbing over a pile of rubble.
The bank of rubble that barred the entrance to the fire escape was about knee-high.
Just as she was about to clamber over, Nicole saw that Frank was hanging back. She
stopped beside him and begged him to come with her, imploring him to think of the
family. He shook his head and told her to go on, without him. There were people on
their floor who’d been hurt by the blast, he said; he would follow her down as soon as
he had helped the injured on their way. She could tell that she would have no success
in swaying her husband; his belief in the building was absolute; he was not persuaded
that the structure was seriously harmed - nor for that matter was she, but now she could
only think of her children. She joined the people in the stairway while Frank stayed
behind to direct the line.
Frank must have gone back to the Port Authority offices shortly afterwards for he
made a call from his desk at about nine o’clock. He called his sister Nina on West 93rd
street in Manhattan and said: ‘Nicole and I are fine. Don’t worry.’
Nicole remembers the descent as quiet and orderly. The evacuees went down in single
English: Grade 12

105

file, leaving room for the firemen who were running in the opposite direction. All along
the way, people helped each other, offering water and support to those who needed
them. On every floor, there were people to direct the evacuees and there was never
any sense of panic. In the lower reaches of the building, there was even electricity. The
descent took about half an hour, and on reaching the plaza Nicole began to walk in
the direction of the Brooklyn Bridge. She was within a few hundred feet of the Bridge
when the first tower collapsed. “It was like the onset of a nuclear winter,” she recalls.
“Suddenly everything went absolutely quiet and you were in the middle of a fog that
was as blindingly bright as a snowstorm on a sunny day.”
It was early evening by the time Nicole reached her home in Fort Greene. She had
received calls from several people who had seen Frank on their way down the fire
escape, but he had not been heard from directly. Their children stayed with us that
night while Nicole sat up with Frank’s sister, Nina, waiting by the telephone. It was
decided that the children would not be told anything until there was more news.
Next morning, Nicole decided that her children had to be told that there was no word
of their father. Both she and Nina were calm and perfectly collected when they arrived
at our door; although they had not slept all night, neither their faces nor their bearing
betrayed the slightest sign of what they had lived through. Nicole’s voice was grave
but unwavering as she spoke to her children about what had happened the day before.
I was awed by her courage: it seemed to me that this example of everyday heroism was
itself a small victory - if such could be imagined - over the unspeakable horror the city
had witnessed the day before.
The children listened with wide-eyed interest, but soon afterwards they went back to
their interrupted games. A little later, my son came to me and whispered: “Guess what
Dominic’s doing?”
“What?” I said, steeling myself.
“He’s learning to wiggle his ears.”
This was, I realised, how my children - or any children, for that matter - would have
responded: turning their attention elsewhere, during the age that would pass before the
news began to gain purchase in their minds.
At about noon, we took the children to Fort Greene Park. It was a bright, sunny day
and the children were soon absorbed in riding their bicycles and scooters. In the
meanwhile, my wife Deborah and I sat on a shaded bench and spoke with Nicole. “An
hour passed between the blast and the fall of the building,” she said. “Frank could
easily have got out in that time. The only thing I can think of is that he stayed back
to help with the evacuation. Nobody knew the building like he did and he must have
thought he had to do it.”
Nicole paused. “I think it was only because Frank saw me leave, that he decided that
he could stay,” she said. “He knew that I would be safe and the kids would be looked

after. That was why he felt he could go back to help the others. He loved the towers
and had complete faith in them. Whatever happens, I know that what he did was his
own choice.”

“I am Sorry”- The Hardest Three Words to Say
Before you read
a.
b.
c.

Who is Desmond Tutu? What do you know about him?
What do you understand by apartheid policy?
Is forgiveness possible in all cases? If not, what kinds of cases cannot be forgiven?

Read the following text to know how black people suffered from apartheid policy
in South Africa and do the given tasks.
There were so many nights when I, as a young boy, had to watch helplessly as my
father verbally and physically abused my mother. I can still recall the smell of alcohol,
see the fear in my mother’s eyes and feel the hopeless despair that comes when we see
people we love hurting each other in incomprehensible ways. I would not wish that
experience on anyone, especially not a child.
If I dwell on those memories, I can feel myself wanting to hurt my father back, in
the same ways he hurt my mother, and in ways of which I was incapable as a small
boy. I see my mother’s face and I see this gentle human being whom I loved so
very much and who did nothing to deserve the pain inflicted on her.
When I recall this story, I realise how difficult the process of forgiving truly is.
Intellectually, I know my father caused pain because he himself was in pain.
Spiritually, I know my faith tells me my father deserves to be forgiven as God
forgives us all. But it is still difficult. The traumas we have witnessed or experienced
live on in our memories. Even years later they can cause us fresh pain each time
we recall them.
If I traded lives with my father, if I had experienced the stresses and pressures my
father faced, if I had to bear the burdens he bore, would I have behaved as he did? I do
114

English: Grade 12

not know. I hope I would have been
different, but I do not know.
My father has long since died, but if
I could speak to him today, I would
want to tell him that I had forgiven
him. What would I say to him? I
would begin by thanking him for all
the wonderful things he did for me as
my father, but then I would tell him
that there was this one thing that hurt
me very much. I would tell him how
what he did to my mother affected
me, how it pained me.
Perhaps he would hear me out; perhaps he would not. But still I would forgive him.
Why would I do such a thing? I know it is the only way to heal the pain in my
boyhood heart. Forgiveness is not dependent on the actions of others. Yes, it is
certainly easier to offer forgiveness when the perpetrator expresses remorse and
offers some sort of reparation or restitution. Then, you can feel as if you have been
paid back in some way. You can say: “I am willing to forgive you for stealing my
pen, and after you give me my pen back, I shall forgive you.” This is the most
familiar pattern of forgiveness. We don’t forgive to help the other person. We don’t
forgive for others. We forgive for ourselves. Forgiveness, in other words, is the
best form of self-interest.
Forgiveness takes practice, honesty, open-mindedness and a willingness (even if it
is a weary willingness) to try. It isn’t easy. Perhaps you have already tried to forgive
someone and just couldn’t do it. Perhaps you have forgiven and the person did not
show remorse or change his or her behaviour or own up to his or her offences – and
you find yourself unforgiving all over again. It is perfectly normal to want to hurt
back when you have been hurt. But hurting back rarely satisfies. We think it will, but
it doesn’t. If I slap you after you slap me, it does not lessen the sting I feel on my own
face, nor does it diminish my sadness over the fact that you have struck me. Retaliation
gives, at best, only momentary respite from our pain. The only way to experience
healing and peace is to forgive. Until we can forgive, we remain locked in our pain and
locked out of the possibility of experiencing healing and freedom, locked out of the
possibility of being at peace.
As a father myself, raising children has sometimes felt like training for a forgiveness
marathon. Like other parents, my wife, Leah, and I could create a whole catalogue
of the failures and irritations our children have served up. As infants, their loud
squalls disturbed our slumber. Even as one or the other of us stumbled out of
English: Grade 12

115

bed, the irritation at being woken and the thoughts of the fatigue that would lie
like a pall over the coming day gave way to the simple acknowledgment that this
was a baby. This is what babies do. The loving parent slides easily into the place
of acceptance, even gratitude, for the helpless bundle of tears. Toddler tantrums
might provoke an answering anger in a mother or father, but it will be quickly
replaced by the understanding that a little person does not yet have the language
to express the flood of feelings contained in his or her body. Acceptance comes.
As our own children grew, they found new (and remarkably creative) ways of testing
our patience, our resolve and our rules and limits. We learned time and again to turn
their transgressions into teaching moments. But mostly we learned to forgive them
over and over again, and fold them back into our embrace. We know our children are
so much more than the sum of everything they have done wrong. Their stories are
more than rehearsals of their repeated need for forgiveness. We know that even the
things they did wrong were opportunities for us to teach them to be citizens of the
world. We have been able to forgive them because we have known their humanity. We
have seen the good in them.
In the 1960s, South Africa was in the fierce grip of apartheid. When the Bantu
Education system of inferior education for black children was instituted by the
government, Leah and I left the teaching profession in protest. We vowed we
would do all in our power to ensure our children were never subjected to the brainwashing that passed for education in South Africa. Instead, we enrolled our children
in schools in neighbouring Swaziland. Six times each year we made the 3,000-mile
drive from Alice in the Eastern Cape to my parents› home in Krugersdorp. After
spending the night with them, we would drive five hours to Swaziland, drop off or
pick up the children at their schools and drive back to Krugersdorp to rest before
the long drive home. There were no hotels or inns that would accommodate black
guests at any price.
During one of those trips, my father said he wanted to talk. I was exhausted. We
were halfway home and had driven 10 hours to drop the children at school. Sleep
beckoned. We still had another 15-hour drive back to our home in Alice. Driving
through the Karoo – that vast expanse of semi-desert in the middle of South Africa
– was always trying. I told my father I was tired and had a headache. «We›ll talk
tomorrow, in the morning,» I said. We headed to Leah›s mother›s home half an
hour away. The next morning, my niece came to wake us with the news: my father
was dead.
I was grief-stricken. I loved my father very much and while his temper pained me
greatly, there was so much about him that was loving, wise and witty. And then, there
was the guilt. With his sudden death I would never be able to hear what he had wanted
to say. Was there some great stone on his heart that he had wanted to remove? Might
116

English: Grade 12

he have wanted to apologise for the abuse he had inflicted on my mother when I was
a boy? I will never know. It has taken me many, many years to forgive myself for
my insensitivity, for not honouring my father one last time with the few moments he
wanted to share with me. Honestly, the guilt still stings.
When I reflect back across the years to his drunken tirades, I realise now that it was
not just with him that I was angry. I was angry with myself. Cowering in fear as a boy,
I had not been able to stand up to my father or protect my mother. So many years later,
I realise that I not only have to forgive my father, I have to forgive myself.
A human life is a great mixture of goodness, beauty, cruelty, heartbreak, indifference,
love and so much more. All of us share the core qualities of our human nature and so
sometimes we are generous and sometimes selfish. Sometimes we are thoughtful and
other times thoughtless; sometimes we are kind and sometimes cruel. This is not a
belief. This is a fact.
No one is born a liar or a rapist or a terrorist. No one is born full of hatred. No one is
born full of violence. No one is born in any less glory or goodness than you or me. But
on any given day, in any given situation, in any painful life experience, this glory and
goodness can be forgotten, obscured or lost. We can easily be hurt and broken, and it
is good to remember that we can just as easily be the ones who have done the hurting
and the breaking.
The simple truth is, we all make mistakes, and we all need forgiveness. There is
no magic wand we can wave to go back in time and change what has happened or
undo the harm that has been done, but we can do everything in our power to set
right what has been made wrong. We can endeavour to make sure the harm never
happens again.
There are times when all of us have been thoughtless, selfish or cruel. But no act
is unforgivable; no person is beyond redemption. Yet, it is not easy to admit one’s
wrongdoing and ask for forgiveness. “I am sorry” are perhaps the three hardest words
to say. We can come up with all manner of justifications to excuse what we have done.
When we are willing to let down our defences and look honestly at our actions, we find
there is a great freedom in asking for forgiveness and great strength in admitting the
wrong. It is how we free ourselves from our past errors. It is how we are able to move
forward into our future, unfettered by the mistakes we have made.

What are the children doing in the picture?
What do you love doing in your free time?

Now read the following text about one of the ways of escaping our monotonous
daily routine: a visit to a beautiful place and do the given tasks.
Just fed up with the hectic pace of life in the Kathmandu metropolis, a few of us old
classmates got together and decided to go on a little trip to a little town called Bandipur.
A friend of ours, a native of the place, had told us so much about the place that at last
after much delaying we set out for the weekend to discover the place where none of us
had been before - a place where old Nepal lives on. Bandipur! The very name for us
seemed to spell magic! We were soon to learn that there is a great deal of truth in the
belief that time stops in the town of Bandipur. That a tiny piece of Old Nepal still lives
on in that cool, cobbled Newar settlement.
Our journey uphill to Bandipur, our destination branched off the Prithvi Rajmarg about
two kilometres west of Dumre and which we reached by catching the local bus service.
In less than an hour, we reached the medieval town. If we felt like a bit of adventure,
we could have done the two plus hour steep climb up from Dumre. But with not much
time on our hands, we decided otherwise and in about a three hour bus ride from noisy
Kathmandu, we suddenly found ourselves almost a century back in time. We were in
the medieval town of Bandipur!
History has it that Bandipur was part of the Magar kingdom of Tanahun ruled from
nearby Palpa, Tansen the Headquarters. But Newar traders flooded in from Kathmandu,
Bhaktapur and Patan after the conquest of Kathmandu Valley by Prithvi Narayan Shah.
The town in those days was an important stop on the Nepal-Tibet trade route until it
was bypassed by the Prithvi Rajmarg below in the 1960s. Bandipur, like several other
hill towns, faced several problems during the Maoist insurgency but things gradually
122

English: Grade 12

reverted to normal, and peace and quiet pervades the place once more.
The town derives its name from BAN meaning forest, DI that means water in the
Magar language and PUR meaning a place. So originally Bandipur must have been
a forest area with plenty of water. The town, which is built along a high ridge above
Dumre, occupies a vantage point and from the Tundikhel below one can view the most
stunning panorama of Himalayan peaks from Dhaulagiri, Machhapuchhre, Langtang,
Lirung, Manaslu, right down to Ganesh Himal.
The place was just as our friend told us. With its ancient cobbled streets and the medieval
ambience displayed by old houses that exhibit glorious 18th century architecture,
Bandipur continues to retain the timeless magic of the centuries. Later in the course
of our short stay, we discovered that at the northeast end of the bazaar, was the main
shopping strip. Nearby stands the ornate two-tiered Bindabasini Temple dedicated to
Durga, the guardian deity of the town. Needless to say, we spent the weekend just
lazing around and loitering around the town or making short trips to nearby temples,
viewpoints and some mysterious caves.
Bandipur is probably the only example of a town that is truly a living museum of
Newar culture. Its winding lanes are lined with tall Newar houses and people here
seem to live, as they must have done years before. It is somewhat hard to believe
that a town tucked away somewhere up in the hills and barely three hours away from
Kathmandu has by default managed to escape the ravages of modern day development.
Thanks to the help from Himalayan Encounters and enterprising locals, dilapidated
buildings have been given a face-lift and now come alive once more transformed as
cafes and lodges. Some notable ones are Bandipur Guest House, Old Bandipur Inn,

English: Grade 12

123

Bandipur Mountain Resort, Piya Lodge, Raksha Hotel and Lodge, Pradhan Family
Guest House etc. Ancient temples and civic buildings almost in ruins now throb with
new life and vitality and currently buzz with human activity.
These timely and thoughtful measures have enabled life in Bandipur to go on as ever
clean and pollution free. While we were there we saw no sign whatsoever of two or
four wheelers in the main town area. A living community, the locals are seen doing
their daily chores, the tinkling of bells as women do their early temple rounds, noisy
school children and campus students thronging the main thoroughfare of the town and
villagers, farmers and traders going about their business.
Today the form of business in Bandipur
has changed from the traditional variety. It
is a tourism related business today. Those
locals that migrated down to Dumre,
Narayanghat and to Kathmandu in search
of greener pastures still come back to the
place once in a while to get away from it
all. As our friend from Bandipur put it,
“Yes I still have my house in Bandipur
and will not sell it as long as I live. My
children can do what they like with it
after I am gone but as long as I am around I will in no way put an end to the umbilical
cord that binds me to the place of my birth.”
“Though I have a thriving business in Kathmandu,” he continued, “I still go there to
our old ancestral house with my family to celebrate Dashain, Tihar and other festivals.
My younger brother runs a lodge there and is doing well too and has maintained the
place very well. I don’t know how to put it but when I am up there in Bandipur, after
a couple of months in this Kathmandu hellhole, an indescribable feeling of happiness
overcomes my being and I am completely at peace. When I am there I realize how
much I miss the place. It is my life, my very identity.”
When we were up there we fully understood that feeling of belongingness to the place.
No doubt, Bandipur does have that magnetic pull. It is indeed a magical town and
we were attracted to it immediately. The place is something out of this world. It was
like travelling back in time back to old Nepal of a century ago. Since tourism is now
the mainstay of Bandipur, almost every house is either a café, a pub or a hotel. As
our friend had told us earlier, the local school children speak good English as it is
necessary for family business purposes and moreover, to interact with tourists.”
To our surprise, even small, clean, humble Magar HOMESTAY dwellings with just
two rooms and four clean beds do good business. Exploring the place one morning, we
entered one such place near the town area and out of sheer curiosity, asked to make us
some breakfast. Not knowing what to order we asked the Magar lady to make us what
124

English: Grade 12

she made best. Meanwhile we looked around the spotlessly clean place and saw a little
refrigerator in a corner, a shelf stacked with biscuits, instant noodles, trekker’s food,
cornflakes, different types of beer, varieties of canned food, tea, coffee etc.
Within minutes the lady of the house put before us cheese omelettes, two slices of
bread each and finger chips. Later we washed it down with glasses of excellent milk
coffee. It was perfect and far beyond our expectations. The next morning we visited
the place again. The lady greeted us with a knowing smile and this time without our
saying made us pancakes with Bandipur honey and again milk coffee to go with it. We
unanimously agreed that it tasted absolutely divine! Maybe the local spices and extra
ingredients of love and affection that went into it made it all the more memorable.
The next evening we unwillingly caught the bus to dusty, dirty, crowded, polluted and
impersonal - 21st century Kathmandu to face life once more. The teeming metropolis
soon made us realize what we had been missing. The hangover of Bandipur, however,
has remained so strong that we have decided on another trip to Bandipur in the near
future. But this time, on a longer and weeklong trip to the place!

The Romance of a Busy Broker
Before you read
a.
b.

How busy is life in your city or village?
“Busy life is better than the idle life.” Do you agree or not?

Read the following story to see how busy work schedule makes a man absentminded and do the given tasks.
Pitcher, confidential clerk in the office of Harvey Maxwell, broker, allowed a look
of mild interest and surprise to visit his usually expressionless countenance when his
employer briskly entered at half past nine in company with his young lady stenographer.
With a snappy “Good-morning, Pitcher,” Maxwell dashed at his desk as though he
were intending to leap over it, and then plunged into the great heap of letters and
telegrams waiting there for him.
The young lady had been Maxwell’s stenographer for a year. She was beautiful in
a way that was decidedly unstenographic. She forewent the pomp of the alluring
pompadour. She wore no chains, bracelets or lockets. She had not the air of being
about to accept an invitation to luncheon. Her dress was grey and plain, but it fitted
her figure with fidelity and discretion. In her neat black turban hat was the gold-green
wing of a macaw. On this morning she was softly and shyly radiant. Her eyes were
dreamily bright, her cheeks genuine peachblow, her expression a happy one, tinged
with reminiscence.
Pitcher, still mildly curious, noticed a difference in her ways this morning. Instead
of going straight into the adjoining room, where her desk was, she lingered, slightly
irresolute, in the outer office. Once she moved over by Maxwell’s desk, near enough
for him to be aware of her presence.
The machine sitting at that desk was no longer a man; it was a busy New York broker,
130

English: Grade 12

moved by buzzing wheels and
uncoiling springs.
“Well--what is it? Anything?”
asked Maxwell sharply. His
opened mail lay like a bank of
stage snow on his crowded desk.
His keen grey eye, impersonal and
brusque, flashed upon her half
impatiently.
“Nothing,” answered the stenographer, moving away with a little smile.
“Mr. Pitcher,” she said to the confidential clerk, did Mr. Maxwell say anything
yesterday about engaging another stenographer?”
“He did,” answered Pitcher. “He told me to get another one. I notified the agency
yesterday afternoon to send over a few samples this morning. It’s 9.45 o’clock, and not
a single picture hat or piece of pineapple chewing gum has showed up yet.”
“I will do the work as usual, then,” said the young lady, “until someone comes to fill
the place.” And she went to her desk at once and hung the black turban hat with the
gold-green macaw wing in its accustomed place.
He who has been denied the spectacle of a busy Manhattan broker during a rush of
business is handicapped for the profession of anthropology. The poet sings of the
“crowded hour of glorious life.” The broker’s hour is not only crowded, but the minutes
and seconds are hanging to all the straps and packing both front and rear platforms.
And this day was Harvey Maxwell’s busy day. The ticker began to reel out jerkily its
fitful coils of tape, the desk telephone had a chronic attack of buzzing. Men began
to throng into the office and call at him over the railing, jovially, sharply, viciously,
excitedly. Messenger boys ran in and out with messages and telegrams. The clerks in
the office jumped about like sailors during a storm. Even Pitcher’s face relaxed into
something resembling animation.
On the Exchange there were hurricanes and landslides and snowstorms and glaciers
and volcanoes, and those elemental disturbances were reproduced in miniature in the
broker’s offices. Maxwell shoved his chair against the wall and transacted business
after the manner of a toe dancer. He jumped from ticker to ‘phone, from desk to door
with the trained agility of a harlequin.
In the midst of this growing and important stress the broker became suddenly aware of
a high-rolled fringe of golden hair under a nodding canopy of velvet and ostrich tips,
an imitation sealskin sacque and a string of beads as large as hickory nuts, ending near
the floor with a silver heart. There was a self-possessed young lady connected with
these accessories; and Pitcher was there to construe her.
“Lady from the Stenographer’s Agency to see about the position,” said Pitcher.
English: Grade 12

131

Maxwell turned half around, with his hands full of papers and ticker tape.
“What position?” he asked, with a frown.
“Position of stenographer,” said Pitcher. “You told me yesterday to call them up and
have one sent over this morning.”
“You are losing your mind, Pitcher,” said Maxwell. “Why should I have given you any
such instructions? Miss Leslie has given perfect satisfaction during the year she has
been here. The place is hers as long as she chooses to retain it. There’s no place open
here, madam. Countermand that order with the agency, Pitcher, and don’t bring any
more of ‘em in here.”
The silver heart left the office, swinging and banging itself independently against the
office furniture as it indignantly departed. Pitcher seized a moment to remark to the
bookkeeper that the “old man” seemed to get more absent-minded and forgetful every
day of the world.
The rush and pace of business grew fiercer and faster. On the floor they were pounding
half a dozen stocks in which Maxwell’s customers were heavy investors. Orders to buy
and sell were coming and going as swift as the flight of swallows. Some of his own
holdings were imperiled, and the man was working like some high-geared, delicate,
strong machine--strung to full tension, going at full speed, accurate, never hesitating,
with the proper word and decision and act ready and prompt as clockwork. Stocks and
bonds, loans and mortgages, margins and securities--here was a world of finance, and
there was no room in it for the human world or the world of nature.
When the luncheon hour drew near there came a slight lull in the uproar.
Maxwell stood by his desk with his hands full of telegrams and memoranda, with
a fountain pen over his right ear and his hair hanging in disorderly strings over his
forehead. His window was open, for the beloved janitress Spring had turned on a little
warmth through the waking registers of the earth.
And through the window came a wandering--perhaps a lost--odor--a delicate, sweet
odor of lilac that fixed the broker for a moment immovable. For this odor belonged to
Miss Leslie; it was her own, and hers only.
The odor brought her vividly, almost tangibly before him. The world of finance
dwindled suddenly to a speck. And she was in the next room--twenty steps away.
“By George, I’ll do it now,” said Maxwell, half aloud. “I’ll ask her now. I wonder I
didn’t do it long ago.”
He dashed into the inner office with the haste of a short trying to cover. He charged
upon the desk of the stenographer.
She looked up at him with a smile. A soft pink crept over her cheek, and her eyes were
kind and frank. Maxwell leaned one elbow on her desk. He still clutched fluttering
papers with both hands and the pen was above his ear.
132

English: Grade 12

“Miss Leslie,” he began hurriedly, “I have but a moment to spare. I want to say
something in that moment. Will you be my wife? I haven’t had time to make love to
you in the ordinary way, but I really do love you. Talk quick, please--those fellows are
clubbing the stuffing out of Union Pacific.”
“Oh, what are you talking about?” exclaimed the young lady. She rose to her feet and
gazed upon him, round-eyed.
“Don’t you understand?” said Maxwell, restively. “I want you to marry me. I love you,
Miss Leslie. I wanted to tell you, and I snatched a minute when things had slackened
up a bit. They’re calling me for the phone now. Tell ‘em to wait a minute, Pitcher.
Won’t you, Miss Leslie?”
The stenographer acted very queerly. At first she seemed overcome with amazement;
then tears flowed from her wondering eyes; and then she smiled sunnily through them,
and one of her arms slid tenderly about the broker’s neck.
“I know now,” she said, softly. “It’s this old business that has driven everything else
out of your head for the time. I was frightened at first. Don’t you remember, Harvey?
We were married last evening at 8 o’clock in the Little Church around the Corner.”

Writing
Study the following text and its summary.
Nepal’s migration situation is dominated by migration of Nepalis for foreign
employment. The 2011 census on population and housing showed that almost 50
English: Grade 12
134

per cent of Nepal’s households had a member who was either working overseas or
had returned. While this labour migration has a significant positive effect on Nepal’s
economy, it also has a series of socioeconomic impacts on the welfare of Nepali
nationals and their communities. Exploitation of migrant workers is rife and aspiring
labour migrants may find themselves in a situation of irregular migration or trafficking.
Nepal’s environmental vulnerability also has an impact on the scale of internal and
international migration. Climate change, environmental degradation, natural and manmade disasters cause displacement and dislocation from the land, meaning that many
Nepalis migrate to ensure a sustainable livelihood. Nepal’s open border with its close
neighbor India is another defining and unique characteristic in Nepal’s migration
context. Although the lack of data on this issue is of concern, it is recognized that there
are frequent and extensive cross-border movements, which have significant impacts
for Nepal, both positive and potentially negative. The 2011 census data shows that
nearly two fifths (37.2%) of the Nepali absentees are in India, however such data
has its limitations in the case of an open border where crossing can be short-term or
seasonable and will be undocumented. There are also no records kept on how many
Nepalis work in India or where they are.
Traditionally, Nepali migrant workers sought employment mainly in India,
however from the mid-1980s, Nepalis started also to migrate to the Gulf States
and Malaysia for work which resulted in an increase in migrant workers as well as
in a proliferation of labour recruitment agencies and brokers. The decentralization
of passport issuance in Nepal also facilitated the migration of many unskilled and
semi-skilled Nepalis.
During past two decades, Nepal has also witnessed an increase in the number of Nepali
women who are seeking work abroad and being gradually recognized as important
economic actors. The risk of exploitation and abuse of women migrant workers is high,
particularly in largely unregulated sectors such as domestic work and the Government
has put in place a series of measures seeking to protect women migrants. To date, these
measures have met with limited success and there is still evidence that many women
migrants are in situations of risk.

Summary
Nepal’s migration situation is heavily dominated by people migrating to foreign
countries for employment. According to census report of 2011, 50 percent of
Nepali households had a member who had migrated to foreign countries. Many
Nepalis migrate to foreign countries to ensure a sustainable livelihood. Nepal’s
open border is another cause of migration. Data shows that about 37.2% of
Nepali migrants are in India. Traditionally India is the main destination of
Nepali migrants. However, people have started to migrate to Golf countries
and Malaysia from mid -1980s. There is also an increase in number of Nepali
women migrating to foreign countries for job. This has increased the risk of
exploitation and abuse of them.
Now, summarize the following part of “The Romance of a Busy Broker”. Consider
the following points while writing the summary.
She looked up at him with a smile. A soft pink crept over her cheek, and her eyes were
kind and frank. Maxwell leaned one elbow on her desk. He still clutched fluttering
papers with both hands and the pen was above his ear.
"Miss Leslie," he began hurriedly, "I have but a moment to spare. I want to say
something in that moment. Will you be my wife? I haven't had time to make love to
you in the ordinary way, but I really do love you. Talk quick, please--those fellows are
clubbing the stuffing out of Union Pacific."
"Oh, what are you talking about?" exclaimed the young lady. She rose to her feet and
gazed upon him, round-eyed.
"Don't you understand?" said Maxwell, restively. "I want you to marry me. I love you,
Miss Leslie. I wanted to tell you, and I snatched a minute when things had slackened
up a bit. They're calling me for the phone now. Tell 'em to wait a minute, Pitcher. Won't
you, Miss Leslie?"
The stenographer acted very queerly. At first she seemed overcome with amazement;
then tears flowed from her wondering eyes; and then she smiled sunnily through them,
and one of her arms slid tenderly about the broker's neck.
"I know now," she said, softly. "It's this old business that has driven everything
else out of your head for the time. I was frightened at first. Don't you remember,
Harvey? We were married last evening at 8 o'clock in the Little Church around the
Corner."

Train to Pakistan

Have you ever travelled by train? Share your experiences.
What does it feel like while travelling on a crowded train like in the second
picture?

Read the following excerpt from the novel Train to Pakistan and do the given tasks.
In the afternoon, Iqbal stretched himself on the coarse string charpoy and tried to
get some sleep. He had spent the night sitting on his bedroll in a crowded third
class compartment. Every time he had dozed off, the train had come to halt at
some wayside station and the door was forced open and more peasants poured in
with their wives, bedding and tin trunks. Some child sleeping in its mother’s lap
would start howling till its wails were smothered by a breast thrust into its mouth.
The shouting and clamour would continue until long after the train had left the
station. The same thing was repeated again and again, till the compartment meant
for fifty had almost two hundred people in it, sitting on the floor, on seats, on
luggage racks, on trunks, on bedrolls and on each other or standing in the corners.
There were dozens outside perched precariously on footboards holding on to the
door handles. There were several people on the roof. The heat and smell were
oppressive. Tempers were frayed and every few minutes an argument would start
because someone had spread himself out too much or had trod on another’s foot
on his way to the lavatory. The argument would be joined on either side by friends
or relatives and then by all the others trying to patch it up. Iqbal had tried to read
in the dim light speckled with shadows of moths that fluttered round the globe. He
140

English: Grade 12

had hardly read a paragraph before his neighbour had observed:
“You are reading?”
“Yes, I am reading.”
“What are you reading?”
“A book.”
It had not worked. The man had simply taken the book out of Iqbal’s hand and turned
over its pages.
“English?”
“Yes. English.”
“You must be educated.”
Iqbal did not comment. The book had gone round the compartment for scrutiny. They
had all looked at him. He was educated, therefore, belonged to a different class. He
was a Babu.
“What honourable noun does your honour bear?”
“My name is Iqbal.”
“May your Iqbal (fame) ever increase.”
The man had obviously taken him to be a Muslim. Just as well. All the passengers
appeared to be Muslims on their way to Pakistan.
“Where does your wealth reside, Babu Sahib?”
“My poor home is in Jhelum district.” Iqbal had answered without irritation.
The answer confirmed the likelihood of his being Muslim: Jhelum was in Pakistan.
Thereafter, other passengers had joined in the cross-examination. Iqbal had to tell
them what he did, what his source of income was, how much he was worth, where
he had studied, why he had not married, all the illnesses he had ever suffered from.
They had discussed their own domestic problems and diseases and had sought
his advice. Did Iqbal know of any secret prescriptions or herbs that the English
used when they were “rundown”? Iqbal had given up the attempt to sleep or read.
They had kept up the conversation till the early hours of the morning. He would
have described the journey as insufferable except that the limits to which human
endurance could be stretched in India made the word meaningless. He had got off
at Mano Majra with a sigh of relief. He could breathe the fresh air. He was looking
forward to a long siesta.
But, sleep would not come to Iqbal. There was no ventilation in the room. It had a
musty earthy smell. A pile of clothes in the corner stank of stale clarified butter, and
there were flies buzzing all around. Iqbal spread a handkerchief on his face. He could
hardly breathe. With all that, just as he had managed to doze off, Meet Singh came in
exclaiming philosophically:
English: Grade 12

141

‘Robbing a fellow villager is like stealing from one’s mother. Iqbal Singhji, this is
Kalyug — the dark age. Have you ever heard of dacoits looting their neighbour’s
homes? Now, all morality has left the world.’
Iqbal removed the handkerchief from his face.
‘What has happened?’
‘What has happened?’ repeated Meet Singh, feigning surprise. “Ask me what has not
happened! The police sent for Jugga — Jugga is a badmash number ten [from the
number of the police register in which names of bad characters are listed]. But Jugga
had run away, absconded. Also, some of the loot — a bag of bangles — was found in
his courtyard. So we know who did it. This is not the first murder he has committed
— he has it in his blood. His father and grandfather were also dacoits and were hanged
for murder. But they never robbed their own village folk. As a matter of fact, when
they were at home, no dacoit dared come to Mano Majra. Juggut Singh has disgraced
his family.”
Iqbal sat up rubbing his forehead. His countrymen’s code of morals had always
puzzled him, with his anglicized way of looking at things. The Punjabi’s code was
even more baffling. For them truth, honour, financial integrity were ‘all right’, but
these were placed lower down the scale of values than being true to one’s salt, to
one’s friends and fellow villagers. For friends you could lie in court or cheat, and
no one would blame you. On the contrary, you became a naradmi — a he-man who
had defied authority (magistrates and police) and religion (oath on the scripture)
but proved true to friendship. It was the projection of rural society where everyone
in the village was a relation and loyalty to the village was the supreme test. What
bothered Meet Singh, a priest, was not that Jugga had committed murder but that
his hands were soiled with the blood of a fellow villager. If Jugga had done the
same thing in the neighbouring village, Meet Singh would gladly have appeared
in his defense and sworn on the holy granth that Jugga had been praying in the
gurdwara at the time of the murder. Iqbal had wearied of talking to people like
Meet Singh. They did not understand. He had come to the conclusion that he did
not belong.
Meet Singh was disappointed that he had failed to arouse Iqbal’s interest.
‘You have seen the world and read many books, but take it from me that a snake can
cast its slough but not its poison. This saying is worth a hundred thousand rupees.’
Iqbal did not register appreciation of the valuable saying. Meet Singh explained:
‘Jugga had been going straight for some time. He ploughed his land and looked after
his cattle. He never left the village, and reported himself to the lambardar every day.
But how long can a snake keep straight? There is crime in his blood.’
‘There is no crime in anyone’s blood any more than there is goodness in the blood of
others,’ answered Iqbal waking up. This was one of his pet theories. ‘Does anyone ever
142

English: Grade 12

bother to find out why people steal and rob and kill? No! They put them in jail or hang
them. It is easier. If the fear of the gallows or the cell had stopped people from killing
or stealing, there would be no murdering or stealing. It does not. They hang a man
every day in this province. Yet ten get murdered every twenty four hours. No, Bhaiji,
criminals are not born. They are made by hunger, want and injustice.’
Iqbal felt a little silly for coming out with these platitudes. He must check this habit of
turning a conversation into a sermon. He returned to the subject.
‘I suppose they will get Jugga easily if he is such a well-known character.’
‘Jugga cannot go very far. He can be recognized from a kos. He is an arm’s length taller
than anyone else. The Deputy Sahib has already sent orders to all police stations to
keep a lookout for Jugga.’
‘Who is the Deputy Sahib?’ asked Iqbal.
‘You do not know the Deputy?’ Meet Singh was surprised. ‘It’s Hukum Chand. He is
staying at the dark bungalow north of the bridge. Now Hukum Chand is a naradmi. He
started as a foot-constable and see where he is now! He always kept the sahibs pleased
and they gave him one promotion after another. The last one gave him his own place
and made him Deputy. Yes, Iqbal Singhji, Hukum Chand is a naradmi — and clever.
He is true to his friends and always gets things done for them. He has had dozens of
relatives given good jobs. He is one of a hundred. Nothing counterfeit about Hukum
Chand.’
‘Is he a friend of yours?’
‘Friend? No, no,’ protested Meet Singh. ‘I am a humble bhai of the gurdwara and he is
an emperor. He is the government and we are his subjects. If he comes to Mano Majra,
you will see him.’ There was a pause in the conversation. Iqbal slipped his feet into his
sandals and stood up.
‘I must take a walk. Which way do you suggest I should go?’
‘Go in any direction you like. It is all the same open country. Go to the river. You will
see the trains coming and going. If you cross the railroad track you will see the dark
bungalow. Don’t be too late. These are bad times and it is best to be indoors before
dark. Besides, I have told the lambardar and Uncle Imam Baksh — he is mullah of the
mosque — that you are here. They may be coming in to talk to you.’
‘No, I won’t be late.’
Iqbal stepped out of the gurdwara. There was no sign of activity now. The police had
apparently finished investigating. Half a dozen constables lay sprawled on charpais
under the peepul tree. The door of Ram Lal’s house was open. Some villagers sat on the
floor in the courtyard. A woman wailed in a singsong which ended up in convulsions
of crying in which other women joined. It was hot and still. The sun blazed on the mud
walls…

Who are these people? Name them.
Who are your favourite musicians? Why?

Read a short biography of a legendary music composer Ludwig van Beethoven
and do the given tasks.
Over twenty-three million Americans suffer from deafness, and over seven million from
tinnitus, a continual ringing or buzzing in the ears that is not objectively measurable.
Man is a social being, and deafness is an isolating disease. The socially disabling nature
of deafness was aptly summarized by Helen Keller, who noted that, whereas blindness
separates people from things, deafness separates people from people. Despite the
social cost, however, hearing problems often lack the public recognition that blindness
receives.
One major creative figure whose life was profoundly affected by hearing problems
was the composer Ludwig van Beethoven. As with Milton’s blindness, van Gogh’s ear,
and Toulouse-Lautrec’s absinthism, the one thing everyone knows about Beethoven
is his deafness. Beethoven did not become suddenly deaf, however. His deafness was
a slow process, occupying over twenty years from the first hearing problems to total
deafness.
Ludwig van Beethoven was born into a musical family in Bonn, Germany, in December
1770. With the example of the young Mozart in mind, Beethoven’s father relentlessly
drove his son as a musical performer. As a child, Beethoven learned to play the organ,
150

English: Grade 12

piano, violin, and viola. He
gave his first public concert
at the age of seven. At twelve
years, he published his first
composition.
Beethoven
moved to Vienna in 1792
to take lessons from Joseph
Haydn, and within a few
years was renowned both as a
composer and as a performer.
Beethoven claimed he had
had exceptionally keen
hearing in early life. A loss of ability to hear high-pitched sounds, an indication of
nerve deafness, first became apparent at the age of twenty-seven. By this age, he had
written his First Symphony, the first two piano concertos, the piano trios of Opus 1 and
Opus 11, the piano sonatas of Opus 13, the cello sonatas of Opus 5, and most of the
work on the string quartets of Opus 18. He did not admit to his deafness for another
three years. On June 29, 1801, he writes to Dr. Franz Wegeler in Bonn, “My hearing
has grown steadily worse for three years…I was often in despair. To give you some
idea of my extraordinary deafness, I must tell you that in the theater I am obliged to
lean up close against the orchestra in order to understand the actors, and when a little
way off I hear none of the high notes…Frequently, I can hear the sounds of a low
conversation, but cannot make out the words.” Poor discrimination is classic for nerve
deafness: Beethoven can hear, but not understand.
In the same letter, Beethoven refers to another phenomenon: “As soon as anybody
shouts, I can’t bear it. Heaven alone knows what is to become of me.” His response
indicates that he is suffering from hyperacusis, or a painful sensitivity to sounds.
In deafness, the lower threshold for hearing is raised; sounds must be louder to be
perceived comfortably. But the upper threshold for comfortable hearing for a person
with hyperacusis may be lowered. Normal sounds ranging from beepers to coughs can
be painful. For such a person, the sound intensity range in which hearing is clear and
comfortable is compressed both at the upper end and at the lower.
Beethoven tells Wegeler that led a miserable life and for two years has avoided social
functions because he finds it impossible to tell people that he is deaf. After all, he
is a composer! Beethoven remarked on the general impercipience regarding hearing
problems: “It is surprising that some people have never noticed my deafness.” A recent
biographer writes that Beethoven’s deafness led to fear, lack of self-esteem, emotional
disarray, increasing isolation, and self-neglect.
Two days later, he writes to another friend, Carl Amenda, in Latvia, “My most prized
possession, my hearing, has greatly deteriorated. When you were still with me, I
English: Grade 12

151

already felt the symptoms but kept silent.” Thus, like many deaf people, he tried to
hide the problem. Hearing loss began in the left ear, and spread to the right.
Deafness and hyperacusis were not his only problems. Beethoven also had tinnitus,
complaining in 1801, “My ears whistle and buzz continually, day and night…such a
condition is truly frightful.” In 1802, he moved from the noise of Vienna to the village
of Heiligenstadt to help his hearing. There, he wrote the Second Symphony. At the end
of six months, however, it was clear that his last hope of an improvement was illusory.
He then writes a testament in Heiligenstadt stating that his condition had driven him to
despair and suicidal thoughts. Only morality and music kept him from killing himself.
He complained that his hearing condition was hopeless, and although naturally sociable,
that he had to withdraw from society. “How could I possibly admit to an infirmity in
that one sense which ought to be more perfect in me than in others, a sense which I
once possessed in the highest perfection, a perfection such as few in my profession
have or ever have had…. (The humiliation) drove me to despair…I would have ended
my life. It was only my art that held me back.”
These early years of high anxiety for Beethoven were extremely productive musically.
In 1800, he completed, among other works, the six string quartets of Opus 18, the
First Symphony, and the Third Piano Concerto. In 1801, he wrote The Creatures
of Prometheus, a string quintet, two violin sonatas, and four piano sonatas. This
productivity has led biographers to suggest that his hearing crisis was necessary for his
creativity, allowing him to listen to inner sounds without distraction. One biographer
surmises that “deafness may have heightened his abilities as a composer…by permitting
a total concentration within a world of increasing auditory seclusion”. He continues,
“One begins to suspect that Beethoven’s crisis and his extraordinary creativity were
somehow related, and even that the former may have been the necessary precondition
of the latter.” Another writes, “His deafness caused no tragic turn…it was, indeed,
a definite aid that held him back from his worldly desires and kept his eye on his
mission”.
Such suggestions are impercipient: hearing loss, and the associated tinnitus and
hyperacusis, are handicaps, pure and simple. Beethoven’s own words attest to the
affliction with which he had to struggle. It is true, however, that Beethoven noted an
alleviation of his affliction while he was composing, which may reflect a minimized
consciousness of tinnitus during intense mental activity. One musical consequence of
his deafness was a change in emphasis from performing and conducting to composing,
to the cultural enrichment of subsequent generations. In his mid-forties, following some
embarrassing faux pas, Beethoven gave up attempting piano playing and conducting
in public. For the last period of his life, his creative energies were expended solely in
composing. However, it is doubtful that any deaf person could ever consider deafness
“a blessing in disguise,” as Newman claims for Beethoven.
Following his letters of 1801, Beethoven says little about his hearing for a number of
152

English: Grade 12

years. In 1804, he had problems hearing the wind instruments during a rehearsal for
the Eroica. In the same year, another friend, Stephan von Breuning, commmented that
Beethoven “has become withdrawn and often mistrusts his best friends.” Misanthropy
and suspiciousness, like isolation, are not uncommon accompaniments of deafness,
perhaps exacerbated by the tendency to think oneself the subject of conversation, or
even that noise, such as the wind, is speech below the threshold for understanding. It is
natural for the brain to make patterns out of randomness in the world around us.
On sketches for the Razumovsky Quartets (1806), Beethoven notes, “Let your deafness
be no longer a secret— even in art.” Such a comment is an indication that he is
accepting his condition and its permanence—again, a not uncommon accommodation
of the hearing impaired after several years of problems.
In May 1809, during Napoleon’s siege and occupation of Vienna, there was fighting on
the outskirts of the city. Beethoven hid in the cellar of his brother’s house during the
bombardment and covered his head with pillows, another suggestion of hyperacusis.
He comments in 1810 that a demon has “taken up his settled abode in [his] ears,” and
makes another reference to suicide: “If I had not read somewhere that a man should not
voluntarily quit this life so long as he could still perform a good deed, I would have left
this earth long ago—and what is more, by my own hand. This life is indeed beautiful,
but for me it is poisoned forever.”
By 1814, he was using an ear trumpet. A selection of these was made for him by Johann
NepomukMälzel, the inventor of the metronome. Beethoven found the trumpets
of limited use, although he always carried a small one with him, as an ear trumpet
magnifies all frequencies indiscriminately. In the same year, Beethoven’s diary records
another reference to suicide.
January 1815 marks Beethoven’s last public piano performance. In 1816, he writes,
“Live only for your art, for you are so limited by your senses.” By 1817, he could not
hear music. He started to use conversation books, in which visitors would communicate
with him by writing. By age 50 (1821), he was totally deaf in terms of social functioning
and speech comprehension, although he could detect low-frequency sounds in his left
ear. He finally accepted that nothing could help him, and never again sought help for
his deafness. In his years of total deafness, he finished the MissaSolemnis, and he
wrote the Ninth Symphony as well as his final six string quartets and piano sonatas.
Beethoven died on March 26, 1827, at age fifty-six of liver (portal) cirrhosis or hepatitis.
The cause of Beethoven’s deafness is essentially unknown, as is the case with many
instances of deafness today. Lack of knowledge has not prevented the growth of
an extensive literature in which various causes of Beethoven’s condition have been
advanced with varying degrees of certitude. Putative diagnoses have ranged from
syphilis, otosclerosis, neuronal atrophy, proliferative meningitis, labyrinthitis, chronic
adhesive middle ear catarrh, Paget’s disease of bone, otitis media, neuritis acoustica,
and hyperparathyroidism. On autopsy, his Eustachian tube was narrowed and the
English: Grade 12

153

auditory nerves were atrophied. The latter finding confirms that he had nerve deafness,
but does not indicate what caused it. Although the arteries to the ear were narrowed,
vascular insufficiency would have produced middle ear deafness rather than nerve
deafness (high tone loss).

Migration and Diaspora

Reading

Dediasporization: Homeland and Hostland
Before you read
a.
b.
c.

What is the approximate number of Nepali people living in foreign countries?
How long can people continue speaking their native language in foreign countries?
Are people likely to permanently return to their homeland once they have settled
down in the foreign countries? Give reasons.

Read the following text about the movement of human beings from homeland to
hostland and vice versa and do the given tasks.
The literature on international migration usually identifies three aspects of the
phenomenon: (1) forward motion, with a focus on its causes and consequences, (2) the
migrants themselves (settlers, sojourners, refugees, and exiles) and their incorporation
in a new social formation, with a focus on the establishment of diasporic communities,
transnational spaces, and bipolar identities, and which also addresses the issue of the
lack of fit between state and transnation, the expansion of dual citizenship rights,
and the remittances that diasporans send to the homeland, and (3) backward motion,
with a focus on the returnee population and their reincorporation in the sending
country. However, little emphasis has been placed on the pluridimensionality of the
dediasporization phenomenon. Such an emphasis could serve as a counterweight to
broad literature on structural and cultural assimilation.
Of course, assimilation has been used as a frame of analysis more in the study of
integration of migrants than in the reincorporation of returnees because researchers
tend to assume that the latter is a passing problem unlikely to endure because
these individuals are now in their homeland. Although it is important to study the
160

English: Grade 12

diasporization process to understand the unfolding of immigration, it is as important
to understand the dediasporization process, because it too shapes both homeland and
hostland policies and because it is an aspect of the globalization process. Because
dediasporization can occur in both the sending and the receiving countries, it deserves
some attention: it can clarify both homeland and hostland identities, the parameters
of diasporic identity, and the making, unmaking, and remaking of returnee identities.
Dediasporization has been defined “as the regrouping or in-gathering of dispersed
people . . . when a community returned to its place of origin.” This definition emphasizes
only one aspect of the process and equates it with physical relocation to the homeland.
By contrast, dediasporization is defined as the process by which a diasporic subject
either reacquires homeland citizenship by returning to the sending country, effects
generational assimilation in the host state, or reinscribes himself or herself in the
transnational circuit of the transnation-state. This definition identifies three distinct
locales where dediasporization can be effected: the homeland, the hostland, and the
translocal arena of the transnation-state. For those who were not born in the homeland,
as Nicholas Van Hear states, “return is somewhat of a misnomer.” It is not return per
se to one’s former place of residence, but rather to an ancestral territory.
As we will see, dediasporization for individuals who never gave up their citizenship or
acquired a new citizenship usually is a smooth process that requires only one’s return to
one’s homeland as if one has never left it. For those who once held another citizenship,
however, states have established formal procedures for dediasporization, which entail
a residence period and the recovery of some citizenship rights. Dediasporization
activates a process that entails the participation of three sets of actors to ensure a
successful outcome and cannot be assumed to be the work of the diasporan alone. This
is so because the individual, the state, and society have distinct roles to play in the
deployment of the process, and none of them can assume or ignore the contributions
of the others, in the various phases of dediasporization.
The individual must be willing to initiate the process, and there are multiple reasons
for doing so: desire to return to the homeland, generational factors, or the subjective
redefinition of oneself through assimilation in the hostland. However, in practice and
objectively speaking, a diasporan cannot dediasporize himself or herself without going
through formal state procedures to reacquire one’s nationality and citizenship. This is
why the role of the state is so important in the process.
The state intervenes in the process to assure itself of the eligibility of such a person to
reacquire state citizenship, with all of its privileges and obligations. Such mechanisms
are often inserted in the constitution or special laws, which provide a frame of reference
for this type of legal intervention. States that consider their diasporas still to be citizens
have less elaborate procedures to validate one’s citizenship after one’s return to the
homeland. In contrast, states that do not endorse the concept that “once a subject, always
a subject” have established more complicated procedures to regain citizenship. Here
English: Grade 12

161

again, considerations for regaining citizenship vary greatly in relation to residency, the
abdication of one’s citizenship, and one’s legal status upon return (whether it was a
personal decision or a prisoner extradition).
The level of citizenship that the state is willing to confer on an individual also varies:
full citizenship (Israel), limited citizenship but barred from seeking the office of the
presidency (Haiti), the acquisition of nationality but not citizenship (the dual nationality
laws of Mexico). The individual may have different reasons for regaining his or her
citizenship, but the state follows procedures fixed in law to make a decision on each
case. One may assume that not all cases meet the state’s test and that not all of the
requests are granted or are granted with longer delay in comparison with other cases.
This further underlines state importance in the dediasporization process.
The integration of citizens in society also depends on the state’s bestowal of legal
legitimacy. The consequent recognition of the diasporan by society through social
practices glues the system together, and this is perhaps the most difficult test for the
diasporan to pass. Chinese have been living in the Caribbean for more than a century,
but they are still considered by the locals as foreigners. In many societies, returnees
face the same dilemma. Their past experiences abroad as citizens of another country
place them in a different category. They are seen as having a different social standing
because of their transnational relations and sometimes because of their wealth.
In Haiti, the populace refers to returnees as diasporas, a distinct status that separates
them from the rest of society. Likewise, Russian German returnees from Kazakhstan
and Uzbekistan have confronted a similar dilemma after they have regained or
acquired German citizenship and begun living in Germany. Regina Romhild notes that
“in contrast to their official acknowledgement as German citizens with full rights from
the day of their arrival onwards they are primarily perceived as Russians in everyday
interactions with German and non-German residents.” Social recognition may not be
crucial once the legal procedure is achieved, but it still marks a distinction between
the group and the rest of society. Either because of this unresolved issue or because of
the unwillingness of returnees to integrate, dediasporized citizens tend to form their
own group, keep in contact with each other, speak a foreign language when they meet,
maintain manners they acquired abroad, and sometimes participate in a transnational
circuit of parents and friends who live abroad. In Israel, for example, some returnees
have gone so far as to form their own political party, as in the case of Israel Beiteiny,
which caters to the interests of Israelis of Russian background, and to establish a
separate organization, as in the case of the Association of Canadian and American
Jews, which celebrates American holidays and serves as an ambassador of goodwill
on behalf of these two countries.
In all this, the role of the state is central. Indeed, the identity of the state can be revealed
through a focus on whether it allows or prevents dediasporization. Those states that
prevent immigrants from being dediasporized tie their citizenship or naturalization
162

English: Grade 12

to that issue. Unable to become a citizen, the immigrant is forced to remain a
diasporan because the conversion or transformation into a non-other is not legally
possible. So laws against re-attainment of full citizenship are also laws of permanent
exclusion and diasporization. Here the state intervenes through its legal system to
establish a discriminatory system that actively prevents dediasporization. Such a state
is inclusionary only at the internal exclusionary level, but is not exclusionary at the
macro-inclusionary level. By such a practice a state eliminates the ambiguity of the
diasporic identity, for the status is permanent and not transitory.
A preventive policy by the state leads to the establishment of a diaspora zone, and
space for the flourishing of diasporic identity. Not only does such a policy reveal the
identity of the state, but it also reveals the identity of the diaspora, because this is the
result of negotiation between the two entities. Individuals placed in a distinct legal site
are called to create their own consciousness from this space. It also places the diaspora
in a structural position where it can entertain its relations with the sending state. In
other words, the exclusionary policy of the state limits the domain of expansion of the
diaspora and its eventual dediasporization through assimilation.
The capacity for dediasporization is not simply a state affair, but falls also under the
domain of the individual who must act to pursue this option. The maintenance of a
diaspora status depends on the ability of the individual or community to maintain “two
types of autonomy”: vis-à-vis the hostland, to prevent full assimilation and a lack of
cultural specificity, and vis-à-vis the homeland, in order to be able “to freely select
its strategies of integration and its own criteria of identification and socialization.”
Dediasporization implies that the individual or group has foresworn its ability to
maintain its distance vis-à-vis these two entities and has lost its active diaspora status.
Assimilation, however, does not ipso facto imply dediasporization, because such a
status can be in a dormant phase and can be revived in a situation of persecution. The
willingness of the individual to participate in such a scheme is essential for the process
to be fully realized.

Reading

An Open Letter to Mary Daly
Before you read
a.
b.

What do you know about these female leaders in the pictures?
How did they establish them as a leader?

Now, read the letter of Audre Lorde and do the given tasks.
Dear Mary,
With a moment of space in this wild and bloody spring, I want to speak the words I
have had in mind for you. I had hoped that our paths might cross and we could sit down
together and talk, but this has not happened.
I wish you strength and satisfaction in your eventual victory over the repressive forces
of the University in Boston. I am glad so many women attended the speak-out, and
hope that this show of joined power will make more space for you to grow and be
within.
Thank you for having Gyn/Ecology sent to me. So much of it is full of import, useful,
generative, and provoking. As in Beyond God The Father, many of your analyses are
strengthening and helpful to me. Therefore, it is because of what you have given to me
in the past work that I write this letter to you now, hoping to share with you the benefits
of my insights as you have shared the benefits of yours with me.
This letter has been delayed because of my grave reluctance to reach out to you, for
what I want us to chew upon here is neither easy nor simple. The history of white
women who are unable to hear Black women’s words, or to maintain dialogue with us,
is long and discouraging. But for me to assume that you will not hear me represents
not only history, perhaps, but an old pattern of relating, sometimes protective and
170

English: Grade 12

sometimes dysfunctional, which we, as women shaping our future, are in the process
of shattering and passing beyond, I hope.
I believe in your good faith toward all women, in your vision of a future within which
we can all flourish, and in your commitment to the hard and often painful work. In this
spirit I invite you to a joint clarification of some of the differences which lie between
us as a Black and a white woman.
When I started reading Gyn/Ecology, I was truly excited by the vision behind your
words and nodded my head as you spoke in your first passage of myth and mystification.
Your words on the nature and function of the Goddess, as well as the ways in which
her face has been obscured, agreed with what I myself have discovered in my searches
through African myth/legend/religion for the true nature of old female power.
So I wondered, why doesn’t Mary deal with Afrekete as an example? Why are her
goddess images only white, western European, Judeo-Christian? Where were Afrekete,
Yemanje, Oyo, and Mawulisa? Where were the warrior goddesses of the Vodun, the
Dahomeian Amazons and the warrior-women of Dan? Well, I thought, Mary has made
a conscious decision to narrow her scope and to deal only with the ecology of western
European women.
Then I came to the first three chapters of your second passage, and it was obvious
that you were dealing with non-European women, but only as victims and preyers
upon each other. I began to feel my history and my mythic background distorted by
the absence of any images of my foremothers in power. Your inclusion of African
genital mutilation was an important and necessary piece in any consideration of female
ecology, and too little has been written about it. To imply, however, that all women
suffer the same oppression simply because we are women is to lose sight of the many
varied tools of patriarchy. It is to ignore how those tools are used by women without
awareness against each other.
To dismiss our black foremothers may well be to dismiss where European women
learned to love. As an African-American woman in white patriarchy, I am used to
having my archetypal experience distorted and trivialized, but it is terribly painful to
feel it being done by a woman whose knowledge so much touches my own.
When I speak of knowledge, as you know, I am speaking of that dark and true depth
which understanding serves, waits upon, and makes accessible through language to
ourselves and others. It is this depth within each of us that nurtures vision.
What you excluded from Gyn/Ecology dismissed my heritage and the heritage of
all other non-European women, and denied the real connections that exist between
all of us.
It is obvious that you have done a tremendous amount of work for this book. But simply
because so little material on non-white female power and symbol exists in white women’s
words from a radical feminist perspective, to exclude this aspect of connection from even
English: Grade 12

171

comment in your work is to deny the fountain of non-European female strength and power
that nurtures each of our visions. It is to make a point by choice.
Then, to realize that the only quotations from Black women’s words were the ones
you used to introduce your chapter on African genital mutilation made me question
why you needed to use them at all. For my part, I felt that you had in fact misused my
words, utilized them only to testify against myself as a woman of color. For my words
which you used were no more, nor less, illustrative of this chapter than “Poetry Is Not
a Luxury” or any number of my other poems might have been of many other parts of
Gyn/Ecology.
So the question arises in my mind, Mary, do you ever really read the work of black women?
Did you ever read my words, or did you merely finger through them for quotations which
you thought might valuably support an already conceived idea concerning some old and
distorted connection between us? This is not a rhetorical question.
To me, this feels like another instance of the knowledge, crone-ology and work of
women of Color being ghettoized by a white woman dealing only out of a patriarchal
western European frame of reference. Even your words on page 49 of Gyn/Ecology,
“The strength which Self-centering women find, in finding our background, is our own
strength, which we give back to ourselves,” have a different ring as we remember the
old traditions of power and strength and nurturance found in the female bonding of
African women. It is there to be tapped by all women who do not fear the revelation
of connection to themselves.
Have you read my work, and the work of other black women, for what it could give
you? Or did you hunt through only to find words that would legitimize your chapter on
African genital mutilation in the eyes of other Black women? And if so, then why not
use our words to legitimize or illustrate the other places where we connect in our being
and becoming? If, on the other hand, it was not Black women you were attempting to
reach, in what way did our words illustrate your point for white women?
Mary, I ask that you be aware of how this serves the destructive forces of racism
and separation between women - the assumption that the herstory and myth of white
women is the legitimate and sole herstory and myth of all women to call upon for
power and background, and that nonwhite women and our herstories are noteworthy
only as decorations, or examples of female victimization. I ask that you be aware of the
effect that this dismissal has upon the community of black women and other women
of color, and how it devalues your own words. This dismissal does not essentially
differ from the specialized devaluations that make black women prey, for instance,
to the murders even now happening in your own city. When patriarchy dismisses us,
it encourages our murderers. When radical lesbian feminist theory dismisses us, it
encourages its own demise.
This dismissal stands as a real block to communication between us. This block makes
it far easier to turn away from you completely than to attempt to understand the
172

English: Grade 12

thinking behind your choices. Should the next step be war between us, or separation?
Assimilation within a solely western European herstory is not acceptable.
Mary, I ask that you remember what is dark and ancient and divine within yourself that
aids your speaking. As outsiders, we need each other for support and connection and
all the other necessities of living on the borders. But in order to come together we must
recognize each other. Yet I feel that since you have so completely un-recognized me,
perhaps I have been in error concerning you and no longer recognize you.
I feel you do celebrate differences between white women as a creative force toward
change, rather than a reason for misunderstanding and separation. But you fail to
recognize that, as women, those differences expose all women to various forms and
degrees of patriarchal oppression, some of which we share and some of which we do
not. For instance, surely you know that for nonwhite women in this country, there is
an 80 percent fatality rate from breast cancer; three times the number of unnecessary
eventrations, hysterectomies and sterilizations as for white women; three times as
many chances of being raped, murdered, or assaulted as exist for white women. These
are statistical facts, not coincidences nor paranoid fantasies.
Within the community of women, racism is a reality force in my life as it is not in
yours. The white women with hoods on in Ohio handing out KKK literature on the
street may not like what you have to say, but they will shoot me on sight. (If you and
I were to walk into a classroom of women in Dismal Gulch, Alabama, where the only
thing they knew about each of us was that we were both Lesbian/Radical/Feminist,
you would see exactly what I mean.)
The oppression of women knows no ethnic nor racial boundaries, true, but that does
not mean it is identical within those differences. Nor do the reservoirs of our ancient
power know these boundaries. To deal with one without even alluding to the other is
to distort our commonality as well as our difference.
For then beyond sisterhood is still racism.
We first met at the MLA panel, “The Transformation of Silence into Language and
Action.” This letter attempts to break a silence which I had imposed upon myself
shortly before that date. I had decided never again to speak to white women about
racism. I felt it was wasted energy because of destructive guilt and defensiveness, and
because whatever I had to say might better be said by white women to one another at
far less emotional cost to the speaker, and probably with a better hearing. But I would
like not to destroy you in my consciousness, not to have to. So as a sister Hag, I ask
you to speak to my perceptions.
Whether or not you do, Mary, again I thank you for what I have learned from you.
This letter is in repayment.

Neighbours
Tim Winton

Before reading
Discuss the following questions.
a.
How many languages are spoken in your community? Do people in your
community understand each other’s mother tongue?
b.
How do the neighbours help each other in your neighbourhood?
Tim Winton, full name Timothy John Winton, (b. 1960) is
an Australian author of both adult and children’s novels that
deal with both the experience of life in and the landscape of
his native country. He competed with 35 other novelists for
The Australian Literary Award presented for the best
unpublished novel manuscript and won the prize in 1982 for
his manuscript An Open Swimmer. His novels include That
Eye, the Sky (1986), Dirt Music (2001), and Breath (2008). He also wrote several
children’s books, including Lockie Leonard, Human Torpedo (1990), The Bugalugs
Bum Thief (1991), and The Deep (1998). This story ‘Neighbours’ has been taken from
Migrants of Australia edited by Harwood Lawler.
It is a story about a newly married couple living in a multicultural and multilingual
suburb neighborhood. It shows that cultural and linguistic barriers cannot stop people
from bestowing love and compassion.
When they first moved in, the young couple were wary of the neighbourhood. The street
was full of European migrants. It made the newly-weds feel like sojourners in a foreign
land. Next door on the left lived a Macedonian family. On the right, a widower from Poland.
The newly-weds' house was small, but its high ceilings and paned windows gave it the
feel of an elegant cottage. From his study window, the young man could see out over
the rooftops and used car yards the Moreton Bay figs in the park where they walked
their dog. The neighbours seemed cautious about the dog, a docile, moulting collie.
The young man and woman had lived all their lives in the expansive outer suburbs
where good neighbours were seldom seen and never heard. The sounds of spitting and
washing and daybreak watering came as a shock. The Macedonian family shouted,
ranted, screamed. It took six months for the newcomers to comprehend the fact that
their neighbours were not murdering each other, merely talking.
The old Polish man spent most of his day hammering nails into wood only to pull them out
180

English: Grade 12

again. His yard was stacked with salvaged lumber. He added to it, but he did not build with it.
Relations were uncomfortable for many months. The Macedonians raised eyebrows at
the late hour at which the newcomers rose in the mornings. The young man sensed their
disapproval at his staying home to write his thesis while his wife worked. He watched
in disgust as the little boy next door urinated in the street. He once saw him spraying
the cat from the back step. The child's head was shaved regularly, he assumed, in order
to make his hair grow thick. The little boy stood at the fence with only his cobalt eyes
showing; it made the young man nervous.
In the autumn, the young couple cleared rubbish from their backyard and turned and
manured the soil under the open and measured gaze of the neighbours. They planted
leeks, onions, cabbage, Brussels sprouts and broad beans and this caused the neighbours
to come to the fence and offer advice about spacing, hilling, mulching. The young man
resented the interference, but he took careful note of what was said. His wife was bold
enough to run a hand over the child's stubble and the big woman with black eyes and
butcher's arms gave her a bagful of garlic cloves to plant.
Not long after, the young man and woman built a henhouse. The neighbours watched it
fall down. The Polish widower slid through the fence uninvited and rebuilt it for them.
They could not understand a word he said.
As autumn merged into winter and the vermilion sunsets were followed by sudden, dark
dusks touched with the smell of wood smoke and the sound of roosters crowing day's end,
the young couple found themselves smiling back at the neighbours. They offered heads
of cabbage and took gifts of grappa and firewood. The young man worked steadily at his
thesis on the development of the twentieth century novel. He cooked dinners for his wife
and listened to her stories of eccentric patients and hospital incompetence. In the street,
they no longer walked with their eyes lowered. They felt superior and proud when their
parents came to visit and to cast shocked glances across the fence.
In the winter they kept ducks, big, silent muscovies that stood about in the rain growing
fat. In the spring the Macedonian family showed them how to slaughter and to pluck
and to dress. They all sat around on blocks and upturned buckets and told barely
understood stories — the men butchering, the women plucking, as was demanded.
In the haze of down and steam and fractured dialogue, the young man and woman
felt intoxicated. The cat toyed with severed heads. The child pulled the cat's tail. The
newcomers found themselves shouting.
But they had not planned on a pregnancy. It stunned them to be made parents so early.
Their friends did not have children until several years after being married — if at all.
The young woman arranged for maternity leave. The young man ploughed on with his
thesis on the twentieth century novel.
The Polish widower began to build. In the late spring dawns, he sank post and poured
cement and began to use his wood. The young couple turned in their bed, cursed
English: Grade 12

181

him behind his back. The young husband, at times, suspected that the widower was
deliberately antagonizing them. The young wife threw up in the mornings. Hay fever
began to wear him down.
Before long the young couple realized that the whole neighbourhood knew of the
pregnancy. People smiled tirelessly at them. The man in the deli gave her small presents
of chocolates and him packets of cigarettes that he stored at home, not being a smoker.
In the summer, Italian women began to offer names. Greek women stopped the young
woman in the street, pulled her skirt up and felt her belly, telling her it was bound to be
a boy. By late summer the woman next door had knitted the baby a suit, complete with
booties and beanie. The young woman felt flattered, claustrophobic, grateful, peeved.
By late summer, the Polish widower next door had almost finished his two-car garage.
The young man could not believe that a man without a car would do such a thing, and
one evening as he was considering making a complaint about the noise, the Polish man
came over with barrowful of wood scraps for their fire.
Labour came abruptly. The young man abandoned the twentieth century novel for the
telephone. His wife began to black the stove. The midwife came and helped her finish the
job while he ran about making statements that sounded like queries. His wife hoisted her
belly about the house, supervising his movements. Going outside for more wood, he saw, in
the last light of the day, the faces at each fence. He counted twelve faces. The Macedonian
family waved and called out what sounded like their best wishes.
As the night deepened, the young woman dozed between contractions, sometimes
walking, sometimes shouting. She had a hot bath and began to eat ice and demand
liverwurst. Her belly rose, uterus flexing downward. Her sweat sparkled, the gossamer
highlit by movement and firelight. The night grew older. The midwife crooned. The
young man rubbed his wife's back, fed her ice and rubbed her lips with oil.
And then came the pushing. He caressed and stared and tried not to shout. The floor
trembled as the young woman bore down in a squat. He felt the power of her, the

took his wind away to see the look on the baby's face as it was suddenly passed up to
the breast. It had one eye on him. It found the nipple. It trailed cord and vernix smears
and its mother's own sweat. She gasped and covered the tiny buttocks with a hand.
A boy, she said. For a second, the child lost the nipple and began to cry. The young
man heard shouting outside. He went to the back door. On the Macedonian side of the
fence, a small queue of bleary faces looked up, cheering, and the young man began to
weep. The twentieth century novel had not prepared him for this.

A Respectable Woman
Kate Chopin

Before reading
Discuss the following questions.
a.
How do you feel if someone lives in your house as a guest for a long time?
b.
Have you ever changed your opinion about a person after meeting her/him?
Kate Chopin, original name Katherine O’Flaherty (18511904) was an American novelist and short-story writer.
She was born and brought up in St. Louis and lived in
New Orleans after getting married to Oscar Chopin. Her
first novel At Fault appeared in 1890 and the second
novel The Awakening in 1899. She wrote more than 100
short stories and among them, ‘Disiree’s Baby’, ‘Madame
Celestin’s Divorce’ and ‘A Respectable Woman’ are more
anthologized than others. The language in her novels and
short stories is full of sexual connotations and her novel
The Awakening was condemned for its sexual frankness
and the publishers had refrained from publishing it. Later after 1950, her works
were reinterpreted and she was praised for depicting modern sensibility. The story ‘A
Respectable Woman’ is taken out from her collection The Awakening and Other Short
Stories (2005).
The short story ‘A Respectable Woman’ is structured around the character of Mrs.
Baroda and her inner conflict as she finds herself attracted to her husband's friend. The
conflict follows the pattern of classical fiction and moves from exposition to rising
action and then to climax and resolution.
Mrs. Baroda was a little provoked to learn that her husband expected his friend,
Gouvernail, up to spend a week or two on the plantation.
They had entertained a good deal during the winter; much of the time had also been
passed in New Orleans in various forms of mild dissipation. She was looking forward
to a period of unbroken rest, now, and undisturbed tete-a-tete with her husband, when
he informed her that Gouvernail was coming up to stay a week or two.
This was a man she had heard much of but never seen. He had been her husband’s
college friend; was now a journalist, and in no sense a society man or “a man about
town,” which were, perhaps, some of the reasons she had never met him. But she had
unconsciously formed an image of him in her mind. She pictured him tall, slim, cynical;
with eyeglasses, and his hands in his pockets; and she did not like him. Gouvernail was
184

English: Grade 12

slim enough, but he wasn’t very tall nor very cynical; neither did he wear eyeglasses
nor carry his hands in his pockets. And she rather liked him when he first presented
himself.
But why she liked him she could not explain satisfactorily to herself when she partly
attempted to do so. She could discover in him none of those brilliant and promising
traits which Gaston, her husband, had often assured her that he possessed. On the
contrary, he sat rather mute and receptive before her chatty eagerness to make him
feel at home and in face of Gaston’s frank and wordy hospitality. His manner was as
courteous toward her as the most exacting woman could require; but he made no direct
appeal to her approval or even esteem.
Once settled at the plantation he seemed to like to sit upon the wide portico in the shade
of one of the big Corinthian pillars, smoking his cigar lazily and listening attentively to
Gaston’s experience as a sugar planter.
“This is what I call living,” he would utter with deep satisfaction, as the air that swept
across the sugar field caressed him with its warm and scented velvety touch. It pleased
him also to get on familiar terms with the big dogs that came about him, rubbing
themselves sociably against his legs. He did not care to fish, and displayed no eagerness
to go out and kill grosbecs when Gaston proposed doing so.
Gouvernail’s personality puzzled Mrs. Baroda, but she liked him. Indeed, he was a
lovable, inoffensive fellow. After a few days, when she could understand him no better
than at first, she gave over being puzzled and remained piqued. In this mood, she
left her husband and her guest, for the most part, alone together. Then finding that
Gouvernail took no manner of exception to her action, she imposed her society upon
him, accompanying him in his idle strolls to the mill and walks along the batture. She
persistently sought to penetrate the reserve in which he had unconsciously enveloped
himself.
“When is he going—your friend?” she one day asked her husband. “For my part, he
tires me frightfully.”
“Not for a week yet, dear. I can’t understand; he gives you no trouble.”
“No. I should like him better if he did; if he were more like others, and I had to plan
somewhat for his comfort and enjoyment.”
Gaston took his wife’s pretty face between his hands and looked tenderly and laughingly
into her troubled eyes.
They were making a bit of toilet sociably together in Mrs. Baroda’s dressing-room.
“You are full of surprises, ma belle,” he said to her. “Even I can never count upon how
you are going to act under given conditions.” He kissed her and turned to fasten his
cravat before the mirror.
“Here you are,” he went on, “taking poor Gouvernail seriously and making a
commotion over him, the last thing he would desire or expect.”
English: Grade 12

185

“Commotion!” she hotly resented. “Nonsense! How can you say such a thing?
Commotion, indeed! But, you know, you said he was clever.”
“So he is. But the poor fellow is run down by overwork now. That’s why I asked him
here to take a rest.”
“You used to say he was a man of ideas,” she retorted, unconciliated. “I expected him
to be interesting, at least. I’m going to the city in the morning to have my spring gowns
fitted. Let me know when Mr. Gouvernail is gone; I shall be at my Aunt Octavie’s.”
That night she went and sat alone upon a bench that stood beneath a live oak tree at the
edge of the gravel walk.
She had never known her thoughts or her intentions to be so confused. She could
gather nothing from them but the feeling of a distinct necessity to quit her home in the
morning.
Mrs. Baroda heard footsteps crunching the gravel; but could discern in the darkness
only the approaching red point of a lighted cigar. She knew it was Gouvernail, for her
husband did not smoke. She hoped to remain unnoticed, but her white gown revealed
her to him. He threw away his cigar and seated himself upon the bench beside her;
without a suspicion that she might object to his presence.
“Your husband told me to bring this to you, Mrs. Baroda,” he said, handing her a filmy,
white scarf with which she sometimes enveloped her head and shoulders. She accepted
the scarf from him with a murmur of thanks, and let it lie in her lap.
He made some commonplace observation upon the baneful effect of the night air at the
season. Then as his gaze reached out into the darkness, he murmured, half to himself:
“‘Night of south winds—night of the large few stars! Still nodding night—’”
She made no reply to this apostrophe to the night, which, indeed, was not addressed
to her.
Gouvernail was in no sense a diffident man, for he was not a self-conscious one. His
periods of reserve were not constitutional, but the result of moods. Sitting there beside
Mrs. Baroda, his silence melted for the time.
He talked freely and intimately in a low, hesitating drawl that was not unpleasant to
hear. He talked of the old college days when he and Gaston had been a good deal to
each other; of the days of keen and blind ambitions and large intentions. Now there
was left with him, at least, a philosophic acquiescence to the existing order—only a
desire to be permitted to exist, with now and then a little whiff of genuine life, such as
he was breathing now.
Her mind only vaguely grasped what he was saying.
Her physical being was for the moment predominant. She was not thinking of his
words, only drinking in the tones of his voice. She wanted to reach out her hand in
the darkness and touch him with the sensitive tips of her fingers upon the face or the
186

English: Grade 12

lips. She wanted to draw close to him and whisper against his cheek—she did not care
what—as she might have done if she had not been a respectable woman.
The stronger the impulse grew to bring herself near him, the further, in fact, did she
draw away from him. As soon as she could do so without an appearance of too great
rudeness, she rose and left him there alone.
Before she reached the house, Gouvernail had lighted a fresh cigar and ended his
apostrophe to the night.
Mrs. Baroda was greatly tempted that night to tell her husband—who was also her
friend—of this folly that had seized her. But she did not yield to the temptation. Besides
being a respectable woman she was a very sensible one; and she knew there are some
battles in life which a human being must fight alone.
When Gaston arose in the morning, his wife had already departed. She had taken an
early morning train to the city. She did not return till Gouvernail was gone from under
her roof.
There was some talk of having him back during the summer that followed. That is,
Gaston greatly desired it; but this desire yielded to his wife’s strenuous opposition.
However, before the year ended, she proposed, wholly from herself, to have Gouvernail
visit them again. Her husband was surprised and delighted with the suggestion coming
from her.
“I am glad, chereamie, to know that you have finally overcome your dislike for him;
truly he did not deserve it.”
“Oh,” she told him, laughingly, after pressing a long, tender kiss upon his lips, “I have
overcome everything! You will see. This time I shall be very nice to him.”

A Devoted Son
Anita Desai

Before reading
Answer the following questions.
a.
Will you be ready to sacrifice your career, status, and economic opportunities for
the good of your parents? Why or why not?
b.
In your view, what are the qualities of a devoted son/daughter?
Anita Desai, original name Anita Mazumdar, (b.
1937- ) is an Indian novelist, short story writer
and the writer of children’s books. As a biracial
child born to a German mother and Indian father,
Desai was exposed to German, Hindi and English
language from her childhood. After completing
her B. A. from University of Delhi, Desai began
to publish her stories and novels. Her novels Cry,
The Peacock (1963) Where Shall We Go this
Summer (1975), Fire on the Mountain (1977),
Clear Light of the Day (1980), In Custody (1984)
Baumgartner’s Bombay (1988), Journey to Ithaca
(1995), Feasting, Feasting (1999) and Zigzag
Way (2004) received mixed response from the
readers. She received Shahitya Academy Award for her novel Fire on the Mountain.
Her novel In Custody was adapted into a film in 1993. She published several volumes
of short stories including Games at Twilight and Other Stories (1978), Diamond Dust
and Other Stories (2000). Two of her Children’s Books The Village and the Sea (1982)
and The Artist of Disappearance (2011) became popular among Indian children. ‘The
Devoted Son’ is extracted from her collection of stories, The Complete Short Stories.
‘A Devoted Son’ is a realistic story set in a middle-class Indian family in an Indian
village. The story shows how parents cherish their ambition towards their children and
how a son should fulfill his duty towards the parents.
When the results appeared in the morning papers, Rakesh scanned them barefoot and
in his pajamas, at the garden gate, then went up the steps to the verandah where his
father sat sipping his morning tea and bowed down to touch his feet.
“A first division, son?” his father asked, beaming, reaching for the papers.
English: Grade 12

189

“At the top of the list, papa,” Rakesh murmured, as if awed. “First in the country.”
Bedlam broke loose then. The family whooped and danced. The whole day long visitors
streamed into the small yellow house at the end of the road to congratulate the parents
of this Wunderkind, to slap Rakesh on the back and fill the house and garden with the
sounds and colors of a festival. There were garlands and halwa, party clothes and gifts
(enough fountain pens to last years, even a watch or two), nerves and temper and joy,
all in a multicolored whirl of pride and great shining vistas newly opened: Rakesh was
the first son in the family to receive an education, so much had been sacrificed in order
to send him to school and then medical college, and at last the fruits of their sacrifice
had arrived, golden and glorious.
To everyone who came to him to say “Mubarak, Varmaji, your son has brought you
glory,” the father said, “Yes, and do you know what is the first thing he did when he
saw the results this morning? He came and touched my feet. He bowed down and
touched my feet.” This moved many of the women in the crowd so much that they
were seen to raise the ends of their saris and dab at their tears while the men reached
out for the betel-leaves and sweetmeats that were offered around on trays and shook
their heads in wonder and approval of such exemplary filial behavior. “One does not
often see such behavior in sons anymore,” they all agreed, a little enviously perhaps.
Leaving the house, some of the women said, sniffing, “At least on such an occasion
they might have served pure ghee sweets,” and some of the men said, “Don’t you think
old Varma was giving himself airs? He needn’t think we don’t remember that he comes
from the vegetable market himself, his father used to sell vegetables, and he has never
seen the inside of a school.” But there was more envy than rancor in their voices and it
was, of course, inevitable—not every son in that shabby little colony at the edge of the
city was destined to shine as Rakesh shone, and who knew that better than the parents
themselves?
And that was only the beginning, the first step in a great, sweeping ascent to the radiant
heights of fame and fortune. The thesis he wrote for his M.D. brought Rakesh still
greater glory, if only in select medical circles. He won a scholarship. He went to the
USA (that was what his father learnt to call it and taught the whole family to say—not
America, which was what the ignorant neighbors called it, but, with a grand familiarity,
“the USA”) where he pursued his career in the most prestigious of all hospitals and
won encomiums from his American colleagues which were relayed to his admiring
and glowing family. What was more, he came back, he actually returned to that small
yellow house in the once-new but increasingly shabby colony, right at the end of the
road where the rubbish vans tipped out their stinking contents for pigs to nose in and
rag-pickers to build their shacks on, all steaming and smoking just outside the neat
wire fences and well-tended gardens. To this Rakesh returned and the first thing he did
on entering the house was to slip out of the embraces of his sisters and brothers and
bow down and touch his father’s feet.
190

English: Grade 12

As for his mother, she gloated chiefly over the strange fact that he had not married in
America, had not brought home a foreign wife as all her neighbors had warned her he
would, for wasn’t that what all Indian boys went abroad for? Instead he agreed, almost
without argument, to marry a girl she had picked out for him in her own village, the
daughter of a childhood friend, a plump and uneducated girl, it was true, but so oldfashioned, so placid, so complaisant that she slipped into the household and settled in
like a charm, seemingly too lazy and too good-natured to even try and make Rakesh
leave home and set up independently, as any other girl might have done. What was
more, she was pretty—really pretty, in a plump, pudding way that only gave way to
fat—soft, spreading fat, like warm wax—after the birth of their first baby, a son, and
then what did it matter?
For some years Rakesh worked in the city hospital, quickly rising to the top of the
administrative organization, and was made a director before he left to set up his own
clinic. He took his parents in his car—a new, sky-blue Ambassador with a rear window
full of stickers and charms revolving on strings—to see the clinic when it was built,
and the large sign-board over the door on which his name was printed in letters of red,
with a row of degrees and qualifications to follow it like so many little black slaves
of the regent. Thereafter his fame seemed to grow just a little dimmer—or maybe it
was only that everyone in town had grown accustomed to it at last—but it was also the
beginning of his fortune for he now became known not only as the best but also the
richest doctor in town.
However, all this was not accomplished in the wink of an eye. Naturally not. It was the
achievement of a lifetime and it took up Rakesh’s whole life. At the time he set up his
clinic his father had grown into an old man and retired from his post at the kerosene
dealer’s depot at which he had worked for forty years, and his mother died soon after,
giving up the ghost with a sigh that sounded positively happy, for it was her own
son who ministered to her in her last illness and who sat pressing her feet at the last
moment—such a son as few women had borne.
For it had to be admitted—and the most unsuccessful and most rancorous of neighbors
eventually did so—that Rakesh was not only a devoted son and a miraculously goodnatured man who contrived somehow to obey his parents and humor his wife and show
concern equally for his children and his patients, but there was actually a brain inside
this beautifully polished and formed body of good manners and kind nature and, in
between ministering to his family and playing host to many friends and coaxing them
all into feeling happy and grateful and content, he had actually trained his hands as
well and emerged an excellent doctor, a really fine surgeon. How one man—and a man
born to illiterate parents, his father having worked for a kerosene dealer and his mother
having spent her life in a kitchen—had achieved, combined and conducted such a
medley of virtues, no one could fathom , but all acknowledged his talent and skill.
English: Grade 12

191

It was a strange fact, however, that talent and skill, if displayed for too long, cease to
dazzle. It came to pass that the most admiring of all eyes eventually faded and no longer
blinked at his glory. Having retired from work and having lost his wife, the old father
very quickly went to pieces, as they say. He developed so many complaints and fell
ill so frequently and with such mysterious diseases that even his son could no longer
make out when it was something of significance and when it was merely a peevish
whim. He sat huddled on his string bed most of the day and developed an exasperating
habit of stretching out suddenly and lying absolutely still, allowing the whole family
to fly around him in a flap, wailing and weeping, and then suddenly sitting up, stiff and
gaunt, and spitting out a big gob of betel-juice as if to mock their behavior.
He did this once too often: there had been a big party in the house, a birthday party
for the youngest son, and the celebrations had to be suddenly hushed, covered up and
hustled out of the way when the daughter-in-law discovered, or thought she discovered,
that the old man, stretched out from end to end of his string bed, had lost his pulse; the
party broke up, dissolved, even turned into a band of mourners, when the old man sat
up and the distraught daughter-in-law received a gob of red spittle right on the hem
of her organza sari. After that no one much cared if he sat up cross-legged on his bed,
hawking and spitting, or lay down flat and turned gray as a corpse. Except, of course,
for that pearl amongst pearls, his son Rakesh.
It was Rakesh who brought him his morning tea, not in one of the china cups from
which the rest of the family drank, but in the old man’s favorite brass tumbler, and sat
at the edge of his bed, comfortable and relaxed with the string of his pajamas dangling
out from under his fine lawn night-shirt, and discussed or, rather, read out the morning
news to his father. It made no difference to him that his father made no response apart
from spitting. It was Rakesh, too, who, on returning from the clinic in the evening,
persuaded the old man to come out of his room, as bare and desolate as a cell, and
take the evening air out in the garden, beautifully arranging the pillows and bolsters
on the divan in the corner of the open verandah. On summer nights he saw to it that
the servants carried out the old man’s bed onto the lawn and himself helped his father
down the steps and onto the bed, soothing him and settling him down for a night under
the stars.
All this was very gratifying for the old man. What was not so gratifying was that he
even undertook to supervise his father’s diet. One day when the father was really sick,
having ordered his daughter-in-law to make him a dish of soojiehalwa and eaten it
with a saucerful of cream, Rakesh marched into the room, not with his usual respectful
step but with the confident and rather contemptuous stride of the famous doctor, and
declared, “No more halwa for you, papa. We must be sensible, at your age. If you must
have something sweet, Veena will cook you a little kheer, that’s light, just a little rice
and milk. But nothing fried, nothing rich. We can’t have this happening again.”
192

English: Grade 12

The old man who had been lying stretched out on his bed, weak and feeble after a day’s
illness, gave a start at the very sound, the tone of these words. He opened his eyes—
rather, they fell open with shock—and he stared at his son with disbelief that darkened
quickly to reproach. A son who actually refused his father the food he craved? No,
it was unheard of, it was incredible. But Rakesh had turned his back to him and was
cleaning up the litter of bottles and packets on the medicine shelf and did not notice
while Veena slipped silently out of the room with a little smirk that only the old man
saw, and hated.
Halwa was only the first item to be crossed off the old man’s diet. One delicacy after
the other went—everything fried to begin with, then everything sweet, and eventually
everything, everything that the old man enjoyed.
The meals that arrived for him on the shining stainless steel tray twice a day were
frugal to say the least—dry bread, boiled lentils, boiled vegetables and, if there were
a bit of chicken or fish, that was boiled too. If he called for another helping—in a
cracked voice that quavered theatrically—Rakesh himself would come to the door,
gaze at him sadly and shake his head, saying, “Now, papa, we must be careful, we
can’t risk another illness, you know,” and although the daughter-in-law kept tactfully
out of the way, the old man could just see her smirk sliding merrily through the air. He
tried to bribe his grandchildren into buying him sweets (and how he missed his wife
now, that generous, indulgent and illiterate cook), whispering, “Here’s fifty paisa,” as
he stuffed the coins into a tight, hot fist. “Run down to the shop at the crossroads and
buy me thirty paisa worth of jalebis, and you can spend the remaining twenty paisa
on yourself. Eh? Understand? Will you do that?” He got away with it once or twice
but then was found out, the conspirator was scolded by his father and smacked by his
mother and Rakesh came storming into the room, almost tearing his hair as he shouted
through compressed lips, “Now papa, are you trying to turn my little son into a liar?
Quite apart from spoiling your own stomach, you are spoiling him as well—you are
encouraging him to lie to his own parents. You should have heard the lies he told his
mother when she saw him bringing back those jalebis wrapped up in filthy newspaper.
I don’t allow anyone in my house to buy sweets in the bazaar, papa, surely you know
that. There’s cholera in the city, typhoid, gastroenteritis—I see these cases daily in the
hospital, how can I allow my own family to run such risks?” The old man sighed and
lay down in the corpse position. But that worried no one any longer.
There was only one pleasure left in the old man now (his son’s early morning visits
and readings from the newspaper could no longer be called that) and those were
visits from elderly neighbors. These were not frequent as his contemporaries were
mostly as decrepit and helpless as he and few could walk the length of the road to visit
him anymore. Old Bhatia, next door, however, who was still spry enough to refuse,
adamantly, to bathe in the tiled bathroom indoors and to insist on carrying out his brass
mug and towel, in all seasons and usually at impossible hours, into the yard and bathe

noisily under the garden tap, would look over the hedge to see if Varma were out on
his verandah and would call to him and talk while he wrapped his dhoti about him and
dried the sparse hair on his head, shivering with enjoyable exaggeration. Of course
these conversations, bawled across the hedge by two rather deaf old men conscious of
having their entire households overhearing them, were not very satisfactory but Bhatia
occasionally came out of his yard, walked down the bit of road and came in at Varma’s
gate to collapse onto the stone plinth built under the temple tree. If Rakesh was at
home he would help his father down the steps into the garden and arrange him on his
night bed under the tree and leave the two old men to chew betel-leaves and discuss
the ills of their individual bodies with combined passion.
“At least you have a doctor in the house to look after you,” sighed Bhatia, having
vividly described his martyrdom to piles.
“Look after me?” cried Varma, his voice cracking like an ancient clay jar. “He—he
does not even give me enough to eat.”
“What?” said Bhatia, the white hairs in his ears twitching. “Doesn’t give you enough
to eat? Your own son?”
“My own son. If I ask him for one more piece of bread, he says no, papa, I weighed out
the ata myself and I can’t allow you to have more than two hundred grams of cereal
a day. He weighs the food he gives me, Bhatia—he has scales to weigh it on. That is
what it has come to.”
“Never,” murmured Bhatia in disbelief. “Is it possible, even in this evil age, for a son
to refuse his father food?”
“Let me tell you,” Varma whispered eagerly. “Today the family was having fried
fish—I could smell it. I called to my daughter-in-law to bring me a piece. She came to
the door and said no. . . .”
“Said no?” It was Bhatia’s voice that cracked. A drongo shot out of the tree and sped
away. “No?”
“No, she said no, Rakesh has ordered her to give me nothing fried. No butter, he says,
no oil. . . ”
“No butter? No oil? How does he expect his father to live?”
Old Varma nodded with melancholy triumph. “That is how he treats me—after I have
brought him up, given him an education, made him a great doctor. Great doctor! This is
the way great doctors treat their fathers, Bhatia,” for the son’s sterling personality and
character now underwent a curious sea change. Outwardly all might be the same but the
interpretation had altered: his masterly efficiency was nothing but cold heartlessness,
his authority was only tyranny in disguise.

There was cold comfort in complaining to neighbors and, on such a miserable diet,
Varma found himself slipping, weakening and soon becoming a genuinely sick man.
Powders and pills and mixtures were not only brought in when dealing with a crisis like
an upset stomach but became a regular part of his diet—became his diet, complained
Varma, supplanting the natural foods he craved. There were pills to regulate his bowel
movements, pills to bring down his blood pressure, pills to deal with his arthritis and,
eventually, pills to keep his heart beating. In between there were panicky rushes to
the hospital, some humiliating experience with the stomach pump and enema, which
left him frightened and helpless. He cried easily, shriveling up on his bed, but if he
complained of a pain or even a vague, gray fear in the night, Rakesh would simply
open another bottle of pills and force him to take one. “I have my duty to you papa,”
he said when his father begged to be let off.
“Let me be,” Varma begged, turning his face away from the pills on the outstretched
hand. “Let me die. It would be better. I do not want to live only to eat your medicines.”
“Papa, be reasonable.”
“I leave that to you,” the father cried with sudden spirit. “Leave me alone, let me die
now, I cannot live like this.”
“Lying all day on his pillows, fed every few hours by his daughter-in-law’s own hand,
visited by every member of his family daily—and then he says he does not want to live
‘like this,’” Rakesh was heard to say, laughing, to someone outside the door.
“Deprived of food,” screamed the old man on the bed, “his wishes ignored, taunted
by his daughter-in-law, laughed at by his grandchildren—that is how I live.” But he
was very old and weak and all anyone heard was an incoherent croak, some expressive
grunts and cries of genuine pain. Only once, when old Bhatia had come to see him and
they sat together under the temple tree, they heard him cry, “God is calling me—and
they won’t let me go.”
The quantities of vitamins and tonics he was made to take were not altogether useless.
They kept him alive and even gave him a kind of strength that made him hang on long
after he ceased to wish to hang on. It was as though he were straining at a rope, trying
to break it, and it would not break, it was still strong. He only hurt himself, trying.
In the evening, that summer, the servants would come into his cell, grip his bed, one at
each end, and carry it out to the verandah, there sitting it down with a thump that jarred
every tooth in his head. In answer to his agonized complaints, they said the doctor
sahib had told them he must take the evening air and the evening air they would make
him take—thump. Then Veena, that smiling, hypocritical pudding in a rustling sari,
would appear and pile up the pillows under his head till he was propped up stiffly into
a sitting position that made his head swim and his back-ache.
“Let me lie down,” he begged. “I can’t sit up any more.”

“Try, papa, Rakesh said you can if you try,” she said, and drifted away to the other
end of the verandah where her transistor radio vibrated to the lovesick tunes from the
cinema that she listened to all day.
So there he sat, like some stiff corpse, terrified, gazing out on the lawn where his
grandsons played cricket, in danger of getting one of their hard-spun balls in his eye,
and at the gate that opened onto the dusty and rubbish-heaped lane but still bore,
proudly, a newly touched-up signboard that bore his son’s name and qualifications, his
own name having vanished from the gate long ago.
At last the sky-blue Ambassador arrived, the cricket game broke up in haste, the car
drove in smartly and the doctor, the great doctor, all in white, stepped out. Someone
ran up to take his bag from him, others to escort him up the steps. “Will you have tea?”
his wife called, turning down the transistor set. “Or a Coca-Cola? Shall I fry you some
samosas?” But he did not reply or even glance in her direction. Ever a devoted son, he
went first to the corner where his father sat gazing, stricken, at some undefined spot in
the dusty yellow air that swam before him. He did not turn his head to look at his son.
But he stopped gobbling air with his uncontrolled lips and set his jaw as hard as a sick
and very old man could set it.
“Papa,” his son said, tenderly, sitting down on the edge of the bed and reaching out to
press his feet.
Old Varma tucked his feet under him, out of the way, and continued to gaze stubbornly
into the yellow air of the summer evening.
Papa, I’m home.”
Varma’s hand jerked suddenly, in a sharp, derisive movement, but he did not speak.
“How are you feeling, papa?”
Then Varma turned and looked at his son. His face was so out of control and all in
pieces, that the multitude of expressions that crossed it could not make up a whole and
convey to the famous man exactly what his father thought of him, his skill, his art.
“I’m dying,” he croaked. “Let me die, I tell you.”
“Papa, you’re joking,” his son smiled at him, lovingly. “I’ve brought you a new tonic
to make you feel better. You must take it, it will make you feel stronger again. Here it
is. Promise me you will take it regularly, papa.”
Varma’s mouth worked as hard as though he still had a gob of betel in it (his supply
of betel had been cut off years ago). Then he spat out some words, as sharp and bitter
as poison, into his son’s face. “Keep your tonic—I want none—I want none—I won’t
take any more of—of your medicines. None. Never,” and he swept the bottle out of his
son’s hand with a wave of his own, suddenly grand, suddenly effective.
196

English: Grade 12

His son jumped, for the bottle was smashed and thick brown syrup had splashed up,
staining his white trousers. His wife let out a cry and came running. All around the old
man was hubbub once again, noise, attention.
He gave one push to the pillows at his back and dislodged them so he could sink down
on his back, quite flat again. He closed his eyes and pointed his chin at the ceiling, like
some dire prophet, groaning, “God is calling me—now let me go.”

The Treasure in the Forest
H.G. Wells

Before reading
Answer the following questions.
a.
Have you read any story about treasure hunting before? If yes, what is its title?
b.
Why do you think people take risk of treasure hunting?
H. G. Wells, full Herbert George Wells, (1866-1946) was an
English novelist, journalist, sociologist, and historian, best known
for such science fiction novels. His first novel, The Time Machine
(1895) was immediately successful, and so he added a series
of science fiction novels that revealed him as a writer of marked
originality and an immense richness of ideas. His science fiction
novels include The Wonderful Visit (1895), The Island of Doctor Moreau (1896), The
Invisible Man (1897), The War of the Worlds (1898), The First Men in the Moon (1901),
and The Food of the Gods (1904). He also wrote many short stories, which were
collected in The Stolen Bacillus (1895), The Plattner Story (1897), and Tales of Space
and Time (1899). This story is taken from the collection The Country of the Blind and
other Short Stories.
‘The Treasure in the Forest’ is an ominous adventure story in which two men search
for Spanish treasure, letting greed get the better of their awareness. As the story moves
ahead to show how power and greed corrupt human beings.
The canoe was now approaching the land. The bay opened out, and a gap in the
white surf of the reef marked where the little river ran out to the sea; the thicker and
deeper green of the virgin forest showed its course down the distant hill slope. The
forest here came close to the beach. Far beyond, dim and almost cloudlike in texture,
rose the mountains, like suddenly frozen waves. The sea was still save for an almost
imperceptible swell. The sky blazed.
The man with the carved paddle stopped. "It should be somewhere here," he said. He
shipped the paddle and held his arms out straight before him.
The other man had been in the fore part of the canoe, closely scrutinising the land. He
had a sheet of yellow paper on his knee.
"Come and look at this, Evans," he said.
Both men spoke in low tones, and their lips were hard and dry.
The man called Evans came swaying along the canoe until he could look over his
English: Grade 12

199

companion's shoulder.
The paper had the appearance of a rough map. By much folding, it was creased and
worn to the pitch of separation, and the second man held the discoloured fragments
together where they had parted. On it one could dimly make out, in almost obliterated
pencil, the outline of the bay.
"Here," said Evans, "is the reef, and here is the gap." He ran his thumb-nail over the
chart.
"This curved and twisting line is the river--I could do with a drink now!--and this star
is the place."
"You see this dotted line," said the man with the map; "it is a straight line, and runs
from the opening of the reef to a clump of palm-trees. The star comes just where it cuts
the river. We must mark the place as we go into the lagoon."
"It's queer," said Evans, after a pause, "what these little marks down here are for. It
looks like the plan of a house or something; but what all these little dashes, pointing
this way and that, may mean I can't get a notion. And what's the writing?"
"Chinese," said the man with the map.
"Of course! He was a Chinee," said Evans.
"They all were," said the man with the map.
They both sat for some minutes staring at the land, while the canoe drifted slowly.
Then Evans looked towards the paddle.
"Your turn with the paddle now, Hooker," said he.
And his companion quietly folded up his map, put it in his pocket, passed Evans
carefully, and began to paddle. His movements were languid, like those of a man
whose strength was nearly exhausted.
Evans sat with his eyes half-closed, watching the frothy breakwater of the coral
creep nearer and nearer. The sky was like a furnace, for the sun was near the
zenith. Though they were so near the Treasure he did not feel the exaltation he
had anticipated. The intense excitement of the struggle for the plan, and the long
night voyage from the mainland in the unprovisioned canoe had, to use his own
expression, "taken it out of him." He tried to arouse himself by directing his mind
to the ingots the Chinamen had spoken of, but it would not rest there; it came back
headlong to the thought of sweet water rippling in the river, and to the almost
unendurable dryness of his lips and throat. The rhythmic wash of the sea upon the
reef was becoming audible now, and it had a pleasant sound in his ears; the water
washed along the side of the canoe, and the paddle dripped between each stroke.
Presently he began to doze.
200

English: Grade 12

He was still dimly conscious of the island, but a queer dream texture interwove
with his sensations. Once again it was the night when he and Hooker had hit upon
the Chinamen's secret; he saw the moonlit trees, the little fire burning, and the
black figures of the three Chinamen--silvered on one side by moonlight, and on
the other glowing from the firelight--and heard them talking together in pigeonEnglish--for they came from different provinces. Hooker had caught the drift of
their talk first, and had motioned to him to listen. Fragments of the conversation
were inaudible, and fragments incomprehensible. A Spanish galleon from the
Philippines hopelessly aground, and its treasure buried against the day of return,
lay in the background of the story; a shipwrecked crew thinned by disease, a quarrel
or so, and the needs of discipline, and at last taking to their boats never to be heard
of again. Then Chang-hi, only a year since, wandering ashore, had happened upon
the ingots hidden for two hundred years, had deserted his junk, and reburied them
with infinite toil, single-handed but very safe. He laid great stress on the safety-it was a secret of his. Now he wanted help to return and exhume them. Presently
the little map fluttered and the voices sank. A fine story for two, stranded British
wastrels to hear! Evans' dream shifted to the moment when he had Chang-hi's
pigtail in his hand. The life of a Chinaman is scarcely sacred like a European's.
The cunning little face of Chang-hi, first keen and furious like a startled snake,
and then fearful, treacherous, and pitiful, became overwhelmingly prominent in
the dream. At the end Chang-hi had grinned, a most incomprehensible and startling
grin. Abruptly things became very unpleasant, as they will do at times in dreams.
Chang-hi gibbered and threatened him. He saw in his dream heaps and heaps of
gold, and Chang-hi intervening and struggling to hold him back from it. He took
Chang-hi by the pig-tail--how big the yellow brute was, and how he struggled and
grinned! He kept growing bigger, too. Then the bright heaps of gold turned to a
roaring furnace, and a vast devil, surprisingly like Chang-hi, but with a huge black
tail, began to feed him with coals. They burnt his mouth horribly. Another devil
was shouting his name: "Evans, Evans, you sleepy fool!"--or was it Hooker?
He woke up. They were in the mouth of the lagoon.
"There are the three palm-trees. It must be in a line with that clump of bushes," said
his companion. "Mark that. If we, go to those bushes and then strike into the bush in a
straight line from here, we shall come to it when we come to the stream."
They could see now where the mouth of the stream opened out. At the sight of it Evans
revived. "Hurry up, man," he said, "or by heaven I shall have to drink sea water!" He
gnawed his hand and stared at the gleam of silver among the rocks and green tangle.
Presently he turned almost fiercely upon Hooker. "Give me the paddle," he said.
So they reached the river mouth. A little way up Hooker took some water in the hollow
of his hand, tasted it, and spat it out. A little further he tried again. "This will do," he
English: Grade 12

201

said, and they began drinking eagerly.
"Curse this!" said Evans suddenly. "It's too slow." And, leaning dangerously over the
fore part of the canoe, he began to suck up the water with his lips.
Presently they made an end of drinking, and, running the canoe into a little creek, were
about to land among the thick growth that overhung the water.
"We shall have to scramble through this to the beach to find our bushes and get the line
to the place," said Evans.
"We had better paddle round," said Hooker.
So they pushed out again into the river and paddled back down it to the sea, and along
the shore to the place where the clump of bushes grew. Here they landed, pulled the
light canoe far up the beach, and then went up towards the edge of the jungle until
they could see the opening of the reef and the bushes in a straight line. Evans had
taken a native implement out of the canoe. It was L-shaped, and the transverse piece
was armed with polished stone. Hooker carried the paddle. "It is straight now in this
direction," said he; "we must push through this till we strike the stream. Then we must
prospect."
They pushed through a close tangle of reeds, broad fronds, and young trees, and at first
it was toilsome going, but very speedily the trees became larger and the ground beneath
them opened out. The blaze of the sunlight was replaced by insensible degrees by cool
shadow. The trees became at last vast pillars that rose up to a canopy of greenery far
overhead. Dim white flowers hung from their stems, and ropy creepers swung from
tree to tree. The shadow deepened. On the ground, blotched fungi and a red-brown
incrustation became frequent.
Evans shivered. "It seems almost cold here after the blaze outside."
"I hope we are keeping to the straight," said Hooker.
Presently they saw, far ahead, a gap in the sombre darkness where white shafts of hot
sunlight smote into the forest. There also was brilliant green undergrowth and coloured
flowers. Then they heard the rush of water.
"Here is the river. We should be close to it now," said Hooker.
The vegetation was thick by the river bank. Great plants, as yet unnamed, grew among
the roots of the big trees, and spread rosettes of huge green fans towards the strip of
sky. Many flowers and a creeper with shiny foliage clung to the exposed stems. On the
water of the broad, quiet pool which the treasure-seekers now overlooked there floated
big oval leaves and a waxen, pinkish-white flower not unlike a water-lily. Further, as
the river bent away from them, the water suddenly frothed and became noisy in a rapid.
"Well?" said Evans.
202

English: Grade 12

"We have swerved a little from the straight," said Hooker. "That was to be expected."
He turned and looked into the dim cool shadows of the silent forest behind them. "If
we beat a little way up and down the stream we should come to something."
"You said--" began Evans.
"He said there was a heap of stones," said Hooker.
The two men looked at each other for a moment.
"Let us try a little down-stream first," said Evans.
They advanced slowly, looking curiously about them. Suddenly Evans stopped. "What
the devil's that?" he said.
Hooker followed his finger. "Something blue," he said. It had come into view as they
topped a gentle swell of the ground. Then he began to distinguish what it was.
He advanced suddenly with hasty steps, until the body that belonged to the limp hand
and arm had become visible. His grip tightened on the implement he carried. The
thing was the figure of a Chinaman lying on his face. The abandon of the pose was
unmistakable.
The two men drew closer together, and stood staring silently at this ominous dead
body. It lay in a clear space among the trees. Nearby was a spade after the Chinese
pattern, and further off lay a scattered heap of stones, close to a freshly dug hole.
"Somebody has been here before," said Hooker, clearing his throat.
Then suddenly Evans began to swear and rave, and stamp upon the ground.
Hooker turned white but said nothing. He advanced towards the prostrate body. He
saw the neck was puffed and purple, and the hands and ankles swollen. "Pah!" he said,
and suddenly turned away and went towards the excavation. He gave a cry of surprise.
He shouted to Evans, who was following him slowly.
"You fool! It's all right. It's here still." Then he turned again and looked at the dead
Chinaman, and then again at the hole.
Evans hurried to the hole. Already half exposed by the ill-fated wretch beside them
lay a number of dull yellow bars. He bent down in the hole, and, clearing off the
soil with his bare hands, hastily pulled one of the heavy masses out. As he did so a
little thorn pricked his hand. He pulled the delicate spike out with his fingers and
lifted the ingot.
"Only gold or lead could weigh like this," he said exultantly.
Hooker was still looking at the dead Chinaman. He was puzzled.
"He stole a march on his friends," he said at last. "He came here alone, and some
English: Grade 12

203

poisonous snake has killed him... I wonder how he found the place."
Evans stood with the ingot in his hands. What did a dead Chinaman signify? "We shall
have to take this stuff to the mainland piecemeal, and bury it there for a while. How
shall we get it to the canoe?"
He took his jacket off and spread it on the ground, and flung two or three ingots into it.
Presently he found that another little thorn had punctured his skin.
"This is as much as we can carry," said he. Then suddenly, with a queer rush of irritation,
"What are you staring at?"
Hooker turned to him. "I can't stand him ..." He nodded towards the corpse. "It's so
like----"
"Rubbish!" said Evans. "All Chinamen are alike."
Hooker looked into his face. "I'm going to bury that, anyhow, before I lend a hand with
this stuff."
"Don't be a fool, Hooker," said Evans, "Let that mass of corruption bide."
Hooker hesitated, and then his eye went carefully over the brown soil about them. "It
scares me somehow," he said.
"The thing is," said Evans, "what to do with these ingots. Shall we re-bury them over
here, or take them across the strait in the canoe?"
Hooker thought. His puzzled gaze wandered among the tall tree-trunks, and up into
the remote sunlit greenery overhead. He shivered again as his eye rested upon the blue
figure of the Chinaman. He stared searchingly among the grey depths between the
trees.
"What's come to you, Hooker?" said Evans. "Have you lost your wits?"
"Let's get the gold out of this place, anyhow," said Hooker.
He took the ends of the collar of the coat in his hands, and Evans took the opposite
corners, and they lifted the mass. "Which way?" said Evans. "To the canoe?"
"It's queer," said Evans, when they had advanced only a few steps, "but my arms ache
still with that paddling."
"Curse it!" he said. "But they ache! I must rest."
They let the coat down, Evans' face was white, and little drops of sweat stood out upon
his forehead. "It's stuffy, somehow, in this forest."
Then with an abrupt transition to unreasonable anger: "What is the good of waiting
here all the day? Lend a hand, I say! You have done nothing but moon since we saw
the dead Chinaman."
204

English: Grade 12

Hooker was looking steadfastly at his companion's face. He helped raise the coat
bearing the ingots, and they went forward perhaps a hundred yards in silence. Evans
began to breathe heavily. "Can't you speak?" he said.
"What's the matter with you?" said Hooker.
Evans stumbled, and then with a sudden curse flung the coat from him. He stood for a
moment staring at Hooker, and then with a groan clutched at his own throat.
"Don't come near me," he said, and went and leant against a tree. Then in a steadier
voice, "I'll be better in a minute."
Presently his grip upon the trunk loosened, and he slipped slowly down the stem of the
tree until he was a crumpled heap at its foot. His hands were clenched convulsively.
His face became distorted with pain. Hooker approached him.
"Don't touch me! Don't touch me!" said Evans in a stifled voice. "Put the gold back on
the coat."
"Can't I do anything for you?" said Hooker.
"Put the gold back on the coat."
As Hooker handled the ingots he felt a little prick on the ball of his thumb. He looked
at his hand and saw a slender thorn, perhaps two inches in length.
Evans gave an inarticulate cry and rolled over.
Hooker's jaw dropped. He stared at the thorn for a moment with dilated eyes. Then
he looked at Evans, who was now crumpled together on the ground, his back bending
and straightening spasmodically. Then he looked through the pillars of the trees and
net-work of creeper stems, to where in the dim grey shadow the blue-clad body of the
Chinaman was still indistinctly visible. He thought of the little dashes in the corner of
the plan, and in a moment he understood.
"God help me!" he said. For the thorns were similar to those the Dyaks poison and use
in their blowing-tubes. He understood now what Chang-hi's assurance of the safety of
his treasure meant. He understood that grin now.
"Evans!" he cried.
But Evans was silent and motionless, save for a horrible spasmodic twitching of his
limbs. A profound silence brooded over the forest.
Then Hooker began to suck furiously at the little pink spot on the ball of his
thumb--sucking for dear life. Presently he felt a strange aching pain in his arms
and shoulders, and his fingers seemed difficult to bend. Then he knew that sucking
was no good.
Abruptly he stopped, and sitting down by the pile of ingots, and resting his chin upon
English: Grade 12

205

his hands and his elbows upon his knees, stared at the distorted but still quivering
body of his companion. Chang-hi's grin came into his mind again. The dull pain spread
towards his throat and grew slowly in intensity. Far above him a faint breeze stirred the
greenery, and the white petals of some unknown flower came floating down through
the gloom.

Lu Xun (1881-1936) is the pen name of the writer born
as Zhou Shuren. He was born to a family with a strong
Confucian background. His grandfather served as a high
official in Beijing, and his father was also a scholar. Lu
Xun has been considered China's greatest writer in the
20th century. He was a short story writer, essayist, and
translator who is commonly considered the ‘father of
modern Chinese literature.’ Known for his satirical
observations of early 20th-century Chinese society, he is
celebrated as a pioneer of modern vernacular Chinese literature and was one of the
most important thinkers of his time. His popular novels and short story collections
include A Madman's Diary (1918), Kong Yiji (1918), Medicine (1919), Tomorrow
(1920), An Incident (1920), The Story of Hair (1920), A Storm in a Teacup (1920),
Hometown (1921). The story ‘My Old Home’ is taken from the short story collection
Hometown.
‘My Old Home’ is a story about Xun’s memories, from youth to middle age that
depicts the conflict between memories and realities. The story describes how Xun feels
while being away from home for many years. Upon arriving at his long-past home, his
memories are forced to come to confront with the realities. His prior conceptions and
understandings of the world come into conflict with his realities.
Braving the bone-cold weather, I was headed back to my hometown, a hometown from
which I was separated by over six hundred miles and more than twenty years.
It was in the depth of winter and as I drew closer to the place where I’d grown up, the
sky clouded over and a cold wind whistled into the cabin of my boat. Through a crack
in the canopy, I peered out in the distance. Scattered across the distant horizon, towns
and villages came into view under a vast and graying sky: they were drab, desolate,
devoid of any semblance of life. I was assailed by a depression against which I was
utterly powerless.
No! This was not the countryside I had recalled time and again for more than twenty
208

English: Grade 12

years. The area I remembered was far, far more lovely. And yet, had you demanded that
I summon its beauties from the recesses of memory or catalog its various excellences,
no concrete image would have appeared in my mind’s eye and I would have been
unable to reply. My “hometown” was probably nothing more than what lay before
me. “This is probably what it really was like,” I told myself. “To be sure, there are no
signs of progress, but then again it’s probably not so depressing as I seem to feel at the
moment either. Perhaps it’s just that my attitude has changed, especially since I’m not
coming back in a happy mood to begin with.”
My sole purpose in coming back this time was to bid my home an everlasting farewell.
The old family compound in which members of our clan had lived for so many years
had already been sold lock, stock, and barrel to people of another surname. The
transaction was to be completed by the end of the year. In the short interim before the
New Year, we would have to take our final leave of those comfortable old rooms and
move away from this familiar countryside to the strange faraway place where I now
earned my keep.
Early the next morning I stood before the gate of our family compound. Up on the tile
roof, broken stalks of withered vines trembled in the wind and made plain the reason it had
not been possible to keep those old rooms from changing hands. The pervading silence
suggested that several branches of the family must have already moved out. By the time I
made my way back to the rooms that our branch occupied, my mother had already come
out to greet me. My eight-year-old nephew Hong’er darted out from behind her.
Though she was obviously happy to see me, I also read hints of melancholy in her
face. She bade me sit down and rest, gave me some tea, but avoided any mention of
the impending move. Hong’er, whom I had never seen before, stood off at a distance
observing me.
At long last, we broached the subject of moving. I said I had already rented a place for
us and even bought a few sticks of furniture. I explained that we would have to sell our
household goods down here and then use the money to buy whatever else we might
need up north. Mother readily assented. She already had our baggage pretty much
gathered together and ready to go. On her own initiative, she had even sold the heavy
furniture that couldn’t readily be moved. She had not yet, however, been able to collect
the money people owed her for it.
“As soon as you’ve rested a day or so, you can make the rounds of our relatives and
then we’ll be all set,” she told me.
“Yes, Mother.”
“And don’t forget to see Runtu. He asks for you every time he comes by. Says he
would really like to see you again. I told him around what day you’d be back, so he
could show up most anytime.”
Instantaneously, a marvelous scene flashed before my eyes: a round moon hanging
English: Grade 12

209

against a blue-black sky, beneath it a stretch of sandy ground planted with emerald
green watermelons stretching as far as the eye could see, and standing in the midst of
all those melons, a twelve-year-old boy, a silver ring around his neck, a pitchfork in
his hand. Suddenly and with all his might the boy stabs at a zha, but the crafty animal
makes a lightning turn, runs back between his legs, and makes its good escape.
The boy in that scene was Runtu. Back when I first met him—it will soon be thirty
years ago—I couldn’t have been much more than ten myself. Since my father was
still alive at the time, our family was still fairly well-to-do, and I was something of a
“young gentleman.” That particular year it was incumbent upon our branch of the clan
to perform a certain sacrifice that rolled around, or so it was said, only every thirty-odd
years. Consequently, it was to be an occasion of great solemnity.
During the first month, images of our ancestors would be displayed on the altar. The
offerings set out before them would be lavish and the sacrificial utensils exquisite.
With so many people participating, it would be necessary to guard against theft.
However, we had only one “busy-monther” to help out and he already had more work
than he could keep up with. And so he suggested that his son Runtu be brought in to
keep an eye on the sacrificial vessels. (Down home, workers were divided into three
categories: if they worked the whole year long for one family, they were “yearlongs”;
if they worked by the day, they were “short-timers”; and if they tilled their own land
but worked for a specific family just during the holidays or when rents were collected,
they were “busy-monthers.”) Since I had heard about Runtu for a long time, I was
glad when father agreed. I knew he was about my own age. He’d been born in the run
month and among the five elements he was lacking only in tu, so his father had called
him Runtu. Best of all, Runtu knew all about how to set snares and catch birds!
From that time on I looked forward eagerly to the New Year, for I knew that when it
came so would Runtu. It seemed that this year would never end. But the day did finally
arrive when Mother summoned me to announce that Runtu had come and was now in
the kitchen. I ran as fast as my legs would carry me.
He had a purplish round face and wore a little felt hat. You could tell that his father
loved him very much, because around his neck he wore a large, shimmering silver
ring. That meant that his father had feared that he might die during childhood and had
taken him before a statue of the Buddha where, in exchange for the protection of his
son, he promised to do something for the Buddha in return. It was then that they would
have put that neck ring on to show that Runtu was tied to life and protected by Buddha.
Runtu was shy with the adults around our house but wasn’t at all timid with me, and
would talk a blue streak whenever we were by ourselves. Before half the day was out,
we had actually gotten to know each other quite well. I can’t recall what we talked
about—I only remember how excited and happy Runtu was. He told me that this was
the first time he’d ever been to town and that he had already seen all sorts of strange
and wondrous things he’d never even dreamed of before.
210

English: Grade 12

The next day, I wanted him to catch birds. “Can’t right now. You have to have lots of
snow. Out by the ocean where we live, I always wait till there’s a good snowfall. Then
I sweep a place nice and clean, take a little stick, and prop up a big, big bamboo basket.
I sprinkle some grain underneath and tie a string to the bottom of the stick. Then I back
way, way off and wait for the birds to come. One little tug and I’ve got them. A little
bit of everything—blue backs, horn chicks, paddy chicks, pigeons…”
How I longed for snow!
“It’s kind of cold now, but you oughta come out our way in the summer. Days, we
could go out to the beach and collect shells—reds, blues, ghost-scarers, Guanyin
hands. Nights, when Dad and me go to guard the watermelon patch, you could go
right along with us.”
“Are you afraid people are going to steal your melons?”
“Nope. If somebody happens to be walkin’ by and picks one ‘cause he’s thirsty, we
don’t take that as stealin’. What we’re lookin’ out for are badgers, porcupines, and zha.
When the moon’s out and you hear a crunch, you know you’ve got a zhabitin’ into a
melon. You grab your pitchfork and…”
At the time I didn’t know what sort of thing a zha was to begin with—still don’t as a
matter of fact—but somehow or other I felt it must look like some sort of little dog and
be fierce as all get-out.
“Won’t it bite you?”
“Well you’ve got your pitchfork, right? You sneak up on him and when you’ve got him
in sight, you let him have it. Are those little guys ever quick on their feet! They’ll turn
around and run right back between your legs if you don’t watch‘em. They’ve got these
coats all slippery-slick, like oil, and…”
I had never dreamed that the world was full of so many new and marvelous things.
Just to think that the seashore had all those wonderful colored shells to offer! And even
watermelons had a danger-filled story behind them that I’d never suspected. All I’d
known was that you buy them in fruit stores.
“Out there by the seashore just before spring tides, you’ll see a whole bunch of jumper fish
hoppin’ all over the place. They’ve got these two little legs on ‘em like frogs and…”
Wow! Runtu’s mind was an inexhaustible treasure-house of exotic things, things my
everyday friends knew nothing about, for while Runtu was out there by the sea, they—
like me—had nothing to look out on but the square patch of sky that was visible above
the high walls of a family courtyard.
Unfortunately the first month of the New Year came to an end and Runtu had to go home.
I wailed. He cried too. In the end, however, his father took him away. Later on he sent me
a package of shells by way of his father, and some beautiful bird feathers too.
And I also sent him some things a few times after that, but I never saw him again.

211

Now, when my mother said that Runtu might drop by, memories of my boyhood
suddenly came alive again as though illumined by a brilliant flash of lightning. For a
fraction of a second, I even seemed to recapture that beautiful homeland I thought I
had lost. “Great!” I said. “How…how’s he doing these days?”
“Now? Well, things aren’t going at all well for him.” Mother turned and looked outside
as she answered. “Those people are back again. Pretend they’re looking at the furniture
and then make off with whatever they can get hold of. I’d better go out and keep an
eye on them.”
Mother got up and went out. I could hear the voices of several women outside the door.
I motioned to Hong’er to come over and chat with me. I asked him if he knew how to
write yet and if he was looking forward to our trip.
“Will we get to ride a train?”
“Yes.”
“A boat, too?”
“First we take a boat and then…”
“Would you look at him now! He’s even got a beard!” A strange, shrill voice suddenly
sliced through the air.
Startled, I quickly raised my head and saw a woman of fifty or so standing before
me. Her cheekbones protruded and her lips were thin. Wearing a pair of trousers (she
hadn’t tied a skirt over them), hands on her hips, legs wide apart, she stood balanced
on a pitiful little pair of bound feet, looking for all the world like a pair of compasses
out of someone’s drafting kit.
“Don’t recognize me, huh? I used to hold you in my arms when you were just a kid!”
I was even more at a loss. Fortunately, my mother came back in at this juncture and
said, “He’s been away a good many years and he’s forgotten everything.” Then she
turned to me, “But you really ought to remember her. She’s Second Sister Yang. You
know, the woman who lived kitty-corner to our place and ran the beancurd shop.”
Now I remembered. When I was a child there had been a Second Sister Yang sitting
from one end of the day to the other in the beancurd shop diagonally across from us.
People called her the “Beancurd Beauty.”
Back then she used to powder her face, and her cheekbones weren’t so high, nor were her
lips so thin. What was more, since she had always been seated, I had never before seen this
“compasses” pose of hers. Back then people used to say that she was the reason the shop
did such a surprisingly good business. No doubt because of my tender age, I must have
been immune to the alchemy of her charms, for I had forgotten her completely.
Thus, “Compasses” was more than a little put out with me. She looked at me with utter
disdain and the kind of smile that one might wear upon discovering a Frenchman who
had never heard of Napoleon or an American who didn’t know who Washington was.
212

English: Grade 12

Her laugh was cold. “Forgot, huh? Case of the higher you go, the snootier you—“
“How could I ever be like that…why I…” Completely flustered, I stood up.
“Well in that case, Elder Brother Xun, I’ll put it right upfront. You’re rich now and it’s
not all that easy to move big, heavy stuff anyway, so why not let me take all this rickety
old furniture off your hands. Poor folks like us can still get a lot of use out of it.”
“I’m not rich at all. I have to sell furniture just to—“
“Come off it. I know you’re a big official—a Daotai, they say. And you’re gonna stand
there and tell me you’re not rich? You’ve got three concubines and an eight-man sedan
chair team to carry you around wherever you wanna go. Not rich? Hah! You can’t put
anything over on me!”
I knew it would make no difference no matter what I said, so I held my peace and
simply stood there.
“Yup, it’s true all right. The more money they get, the less they’ll turn loose. And the less
they turn loose, the more they get!” Compasses angrily turned her back to me and slowly
walked away, issuing a steady stream of chatter as she went. On her way out, she picked up
a pair of my mother’s gloves and shoved them into the waistband of her trousers.
During the next few days, clansmen and relatives who lived nearby came around to pay
visits. I met these social obligations as best I could, stealing time from them whenever
possible to finish packing.
One very cold afternoon just after lunch I was sitting and drinking tea when I heard
someone come in from the outside. When I turned around to look I couldn’t help but
start with surprise. I scrambled to my feet and rushed over to welcome him.
It was Runtu. Although I recognized him right off, he was not at all the Runtu who lived
in my memory. He seemed twice as tall now. The round and ruddy face of yesteryear
had already turned pale and grey, and it was etched with deep wrinkles. The rims of
his eyes were swollen and red just like his father’s. I knew that most farmers who
worked close to the sea got that way because of the wind. He was wearing a battered
old felt hat, and his cotton clothes were so thin that he was shivering. His hands held a
paper package along with his pipe. They were not the smooth and nimble hands that I
remembered. Now they were rough, clumsy, and as cracked as pine bark.
I was beside myself with enthusiasm, but didn’t know how to begin and simply said,
“Brother Runtu, you’ve come…”
There was so much I wanted to say. There were so many words waiting to gush out
one after the other like pearls on a string: horn chicks, jumper fish, Guanyin hands,
zha—but at the same time I was aware of something damming them up inside me, so
that they simply swirled around in my brain without a single one coming out.
As he stood there his expression was a mixture of happiness and melancholy. His lips
began to move, but not a single word came out. Finally he assumed a very respectful
English: Grade 12

213

attitude and addressed me in a loud clear voice: “Master!”
I shuddered as I realized what a wretched thick wall now stood between us. I too was at a
loss for words. He turned around and said, “Shuisheng, kowtow to the Master.” He grabbed
a child who up to this point had been hiding behind him and hauled him around front. This
boy was Runtu—twenty years ago, although somewhat paler and thinner than his father
had been. The only real difference was that Shuisheng had no silver neck ring.
“This is my fifth. Hasn’t been out and around much, so he’s pretty shy.”
Mother and Hong’er must have heard us talking because they came down from upstairs.
“Old Missus. I got your letter a long time back. You don’t know how happy I was to
hear the Master was comin’ home,” said Runtu.
“Hey, what in the world’s come over you that you’re so formal. You two used to call
each other ‘Brother.’ Just call him ‘Brother Xun’ the way you used to.”
“Ah, the Old Missus is really too…What kind of manners would that be? We were just
kids then. We didn’t know any better.” While Runtu was talking, he was also trying to
get Shuisheng to bow to my mother, but the boy was very embarrassed and stuck like
glue to his father’s back.
“Is that Shuisheng, your fifth?” Mother asked. “To him, we’re all strangers. No wonder
he’s so shy. Why not let him and Hong’er go out together and play.”
When Hong’er heard that, he immediately ran over and greeted the boy. Shuisheng
wasn’t the least bit shy with him, and apparently feeling very much at ease, went
outside with my nephew to play. Mother asked Runtu to have a seat. He hesitated for a
bit but finally sat down and leaned his long pipe against the table. He handed the paper
package across to me and said, “We don’t have much of anything in the winter, but
these dried peas are the ones I sunned myself. Please accept them, Master…”
I asked how he was doing. He shook his head.
“Things are pretty rough. Even my sixth is old enough to help out now, but still with
all the fightin’ and people wantin’ money of you every place you turn—you can never
be sure how much—and with all the bad harvests, we just never seem to have enough
to eat. When you do take whatever crop you’ve got and head off to market, you’ve
gotta pay a whole bunch of taxes before you ever get there. Ends up so you don’t even
get back what you’ve put into it. But if you don’t take it to market, it’s just gonna rot
in the field anyway…”
He stopped talking but continued to shake his head. There was no movement in any of
the wrinkles that life had etched upon him and one would have thought that his face
was carved from stone. He probably felt all the pain, but could not find the words to
express it. He sat in silence for a while and then picked up his pipe and began to smoke.
Through further questioning, Mother learned that he still had much to do at home and
would have to leave tomorrow. She also found out that he’d gone without lunch and
214

English: Grade 12

told him to go into the kitchen and make himself a little something.
After he went out, Mother and I both sighed at his plight: too many children, famine,
harsh taxes, soldiers, bandits, officials, gentryfolk—everything had plagued [him]
until he’d become the lifeless wooden figure we saw today. Mother said that we ought
to see to it that he got as much as we weren’t going to take with us as possible. So we
told him to take whatever he wanted.
He selected a few things that very afternoon—two long tables, an incense burner, some
candlesticks, and a set of scales. He also asked for the ashes from our kitchen stove.
(We cooked with rice stalks, and the ashes would provide good fertilizer for the sandy
soil out his way.) He gathered everything together and said he would come for it in a
boat the day we moved out.
We chatted a bit more that night, but none of it amounted to anything. Early the next
morning he took Shuisheng and headed back on home.
Nine days later the time of our departure finally arrived. Runtu came early in the
morning. Shuisheng wasn’t with him this time, but he’d brought along a five-year-old
girl to keep an eye on the boat. We were so busy that we had no time to chat. Several
other people came by, some to see us off, others to get things, and still others to get
things and to see us off. By the time we boarded the boat that afternoon, the old house
had been swept clean of old and used things of every imaginable size and description.
As we proceeded upriver, the twilight-green mountains on either bank took on deeper
hues and joined together in a single blue-green mass as they fled away into the distance
behind the stern. Hong’er and I leaned against the window and watched the dimming
landscape. Suddenly he asked, “Uncle, when are we coming back?”
“Coming back? What are you doing thinking about coming back before we’ve even left?”
“But Shuisheng invited me to go have fun at his place.” Engrossed by thoughts of his
new friend, Hong’er opened his large black eyes even wider in fascination.
Mother and I weren’t immune to nostalgia ourselves, and began talking about Runtu again.
She told me that ever since she’d started packing, Second Sister Yang—the Beancurd
Beauty—had never let a single day pass without coming by. Just the day before yesterday
she had retrieved a dozen or so plates from the pile of rice-stalk ashes. After questioning
my mother, Second Sister Yang concluded that they must have been hidden there by Runtu
so that he could make off with them when he came for the other stuff.
Having made this discovery, she apparently felt that she’d rendered us a rewardable
service, for she picked up the dog-crazer without so much as a by-your-leave and took
off with it just as fast as her legs would carry her. (The dog-crazer was a device we
used back home in raising chickens. It consisted of a wooden bowl covered with a
lattice-like arrangement wide enough for the chickens to poke their heads through, but
too narrow for the dogs, who could only stand around “crazed” with frustration while
the chickens ate.) Mother said she had never imagined that Second Sister Yang could

develop such speed on those little feet of hers.
My hometown receded even farther into the distance and the familiar landscapes of
the surrounding countryside gradually disappeared too. Strange to say, there was not
a shred of regret in my heart. I only felt that there was a high and invisible wall all
around me that isolated me from my fellow human beings, a wall that was squeezing
the breath out of my body. That usually comforting image of a little hero with silver
neck ring standing in the middle of a melon patch was now blurred out of focus and
stirred nothing in me but a feeling of melancholy.
Mother and Hong’er had both gone to sleep. As I lay there and listened to the gentle
slapping of water against the hull, I knew that Runtu and I were going on separate
roads. “Even though we’re irrevocably cut off from each other,” I thought, “didn’t
Hong’er start to missShuisheng when we had barely set out? I hope they’ll never live
like my generation with everyone cut off from everyone else. And yet, just to keep that
from happening, I wouldn’t want them to have this vagabond life of mine, anymore
than I’d want them to have Runtu’s barren one. Still less I would want them to muddle
through the hedonistic lives other people lead. There ought to be a new life for them, a
life that none of us has ever known.”
As my thoughts turned toward hope, a feeling of anxiety suddenly possessed me.
When Runtu took the censer and candlesticks, I had laughed at him behind his back.
“Can’t let go of that superstitious idol-worship of his for a single minute!” But what
was this thing called “hope” if not an idol that I had fashioned with my own hands. The
things he hoped for were immediate, while what I wanted was somewhere far off in the
murky distance—that was the only difference.
As I lay there half asleep, an emerald green plot of land by the sea appeared before my
eyes. In the deep blue sky above it hung a moon, full and golden. “Hope isn’t the kind
of thing that you can say either exists or doesn’t exist,” I thought to myself. “It’s like a
path across the land—it’s not there to begin with, but when lots of people go the same
way, it comes into being.”

The Half-closed Eyes of the Buddha and the Slowly
Sinking Sun

Shankar Lamichhane

Before reading
Discuss the following questions.
a.
What does a Nepali tourist guide think about foreign tourists?
b.
What do common Nepali people think of a fair-skinned foreigner?
c.
Why do you think foreign tourists visit Nepal?
Shankar Lamichhane (1928-1975) was born in Kathmandu but
lived in Banaras with his uncle at a young age. After receiving
college education at Tri-Chandra College in Kathmandu, he took
his first job at the age of twenty-two and worked for a number of
governmental and cultural institutions in the capital. In his later
years, he became the manager of a handicrafts store. Lamichhane
was an admirer of modern American fiction and frequently
mixed with foreign visitors to Nepal. His stories are heavy with
symbolism, often lacking a conventional plot and more closely
resembling essays, but his prose is rich and poetic. This story is taken from Himalayan
Voices: An Introduction to Nepali Literature, translated and edited by Michael Hutt.
The story deals with the monologues of two characters a tourist guide in Kathmandu
valley and a foreign tourist. The story is different from conventional stories and,
instead of showing actions and events, the story records what the two characters think
in a stream of consciousness technique.
Oh guide, you do not, you cannot understand the joy we Westerners feel when we first,
set foot upon the soil of your country!
As the Dakota crosses the Four Passes, we see this green valley with its geometric
fields, its earthen houses of red, yellow, and white. The scent of soil and mountains is in
the air, arid there's an age-old peacefulness in the atmosphere. You were born amongst
all of this, and so perhaps you feel that the embrace of these blue hills' outspread arms
confines you. But we live in the plains or beside the sea. Our vision founders on a
horizon of land or sea, and so we know the affection with which the breast of these hills
forever clings to your sight. You have never had to suffer the feeling of insignificance
that is caused by a vast distance. Perhaps we are always adrift in vastness, my friend;
perhaps that is why this, your enclosure, appeals to us! Has it ever occurred to you that
the half-closed eyes of the Buddha seem to welcome you, even at the airport? It is as if
one acquires a calmness, as if one is returning once more to a resting place.
You have always known only how to give to the West. You've given us religion arid
218

English: Grade 12

the Puranas, images of brass and ornaments of ivory, manuscripts of palm leaves and
inscriptions on copperplate. You gave us a civilization and its wisdom and garlands of
jasmine flowers around our necks. You have continued in your giving, ignorant of what
others call "taking," innocent of the notion of ownership. The very word indulgence is
unknown to you. My friend, I know your history. Before I came here, I spent several
years in our libraries, leafing through the pages of your priceless volumes. You are a
guide who will lead me down the streets and alleyways of the present, but I could take
you along your ancient ways. Even now I can see it clearly: the valley is filled with
water, and a lotus flower blooms where Swyambhunath now stands. Manjushri strikes
with his sword at Chobhar. I see monks and nuns receiving alms and spreading the
law in the nooks and crannies of the Kasthamandap. Behold the eyes of these shavenheaded monks. You cannot meet their gaze! It is called the samyak gaze. Do you know
what that means? It is perception, pure and without contamination; sight that perceives
everything in its true form. I'll have just one more drink before dinner....
You live in a house like a temple, but you are unaware of its beauty, its enchantment.
In these wooden images, these multifarious ornamentations, these many styles, there
is the flowing music of a chisel in the hands of an artist. Do you not feel it? Tell me
about those happy, prosperous young artists working in the fields all day and creating
beautiful images of their personal deities in their spare time, who are now covered by
the dusts of the past.
Once, an artist was adding the finishing touches to a wooden image when his fair, tiny
wife came by, carrying her baby on her back, and poured him Raksi from a jug. The
foam bubbled over and congealed. Is it true that it was that foam that inspired the artist
to construct a roof of tiles? Oh, your land is truly great, this country where so many
different cultures found their home. Aryans, non-Aryans, Hindus, and Buddhists all
came and obtained a rebirth here. It must be the effect of your country's soil, my friend;
it was the soil that enabled all these races to flourish together here. Come, I'll drink one
more small one, it's not dinner time yet...
I am greatly indebted to you for you have served me both Nepali and Newari food. Ah, momos... Just picture the scene: it is winter and an old man sits in the upper story of his house,
lit only by the fire. Perhaps the smoke is filling the room like fog from floor to ceiling.
Perhaps he is telling his grandson about each and every Nepali item that Princess Bhrikuti
took with her when King Amshuvarma sent her off to Tibet. The old lady smokes tobacco
from a bamboo hookah, and, mindful of the old man, she carries on making fresh mo-mos.
The son's wife puts some of them onto a brass plate, and the old man's words are garbled
and obscured by his mouthful. The grandson laughs, and the old man tries to swallow
quickly, so he burns his tongue and, unabashed, pours out a stream of ribald curses. . . .
These are scenes that cannot be read in an old book in a library, and that is why I've had to
come to Kathmandu and soak myself in its atmosphere, for which I'm greatly obliged to
you. . . . Now, cheers once again, to your great country, and to mine!

Oh, and another thing that is not to be found in any book is the smile on the faces of these
people. It is a smile of welcome, as if our meeting were neither accidental nor our first. It's
as if I was the farmer's eldest son, coming home after a long day's work in the fields, as if
my labors had been fruitful and I was content and at ease with my father. It's as if I have
taken the world's most beautiful woman for my wife and have brought her along behind
me, and my mother is smiling a welcome from the door. It's as if my sister's husband and
I were the closest of friends and we, her brother and her husband, were coming along with
our arms around one another, singing songs of drunkenness. It's as if—I cannot explain;
however much I try, I cannot describe it fully. That smile is full of wisdom; it is a smile
from the soul, a smile peculiar to this place. . . . One more drink, to your Nepalese smile,
that sweet smile!
And then there are the eyes. The eyes of the carved lattice windows, the eyes painted
on the door panels. The eyes on the stupas, the eyes of the people. And the eyes of the
Himalaya, which peep out from the gaps between the hills like those of a neighbor's
boy when he jumps up to see the peach tree in your garden. This is a land of eyes, a
land guarded by the half-closed eyes of the Lord Buddha.
Even if all of the world's history books were destroyed today, your eyes would build
a new culture; they would reassemble a civilization. My appetite for eyes is still not
satiated. Tomorrow I shall go to a lonely place where there is a stupa with eyes that
are clear. There I want to see the pleasant light of sunset reflected in the eyes of the
Buddha. Show me beautiful, full eyes, eyes without equal, eyes whose memory will
make this journey of mine unforgettable.... Come, let's go to eat dinner.
Come, my guest; today I am to show you some eyes.
This is Chobhar hill, where you people come to see the cleft that was made by
Manjushri's sword and the outflow of the Bagmati River. Today I'll take you up the hill
where few of our guests ever go and no tourist's car can proceed. There (in your words)
the dust of time has not yet covered the culture of the past. Do you see this worn old
rock? A young village artist has drawn some birds on it. Nearby, he has sketched a
temple, leaving out any mention of the religion to which it belongs. Further up the hill,
in the middle of the village, stands the temple of Adinath. In the temple courtyard there
is a shrine of Shiva, several Buddha images, and many prayer wheels, inscribed Om
mani padme hu.'-' You say it is a living example of Nepalese tolerance and coexistence.
Children play happily there, unconcerned by the variety of their gods, religions, and
philosophies. But my guest, I will not take you there.
You have already seen much of such things, and you have understood them and even
preached them. Today I'll take you to a house where I feel sure you will find the
pulse of our reality. They are a farmer's family, probably owning a few fields here and
there, where they work and sweat to pay off half the proceeds to someone in the city.
There is no smoke to fill their upstairs room, they cook no mo-mos in their hearth,
nor do they discuss Bhrikutl's dowry in their winters. There is a child in the home,
220

English: Grade 12

who is certainly no divine incarnation, either. Attacked by polio and born into a poor
farmer's household, the child is surely incapable of spreading the law or of making any
contribution to this earth. He has taken birth here in one of his maker's strangest forms
of creation.
And moreover, my friend—oh, the climb has tired you; would you like some filtered
water from the thermos flask?—my intention is not to show him to you as any kind
of symbol. Yesterday you were swept along by waves of emotion, inspired by your
"Black and White" whisky, and you urged me to show you eyes that would forever
remind you of your visit to Nepal. So I have brought you here to show you eyes like
that.
The child's whole body is useless; he cannot speak, move his hands, chew his food,
or even spit. His eyes are the only living parts of his body and it is only his eyes
that indicate that he is actually alive. I don't know whether his eyes have the samyak
gaze or not. I don't even understand the term, but his face is certainly devoid of all
emotion. His gaze is uninterested, without resolution or expression; it is inactive and
listless, unexercised and lacking any measure of contemplation. (Perhaps I have begun
to speak unwittingly in the terms of the Aryan eightfold path, which will either be your
influence or a virtue bestowed upon me by the child.)
My guest, these are the eyes you wanted. A living being accumulates many capabilities in
one lifetime. It feels happy and it smiles; it feels sad and it weeps. If it feels cold, it seeks
warmth, and if it is hungry, it prepares food to eat. It seeks to learn what it doesn't already
know, and it succeeds or it fails. It has many experiences, some bitter, some sweet, and
these it relates when company, occasion, and mood seem suited. How commonplace all
of these actions are! My guest, yesterday you said that we Eastern peoples were always
making contributions to the West, did you not? (Shall I give you some water? Are you out of
breath?) Here is a child who can neither give nor take anything at all. Just put yourself in his
position for a moment. You want your finger to do something, but your finger refuses. You
want to speak, but speech will not come to you. Every vein, nerve, and bone is powerless to
heed the commands of your brain, and yet . . . you are alive. I know that this disease occurs
in your country, too. But the ability to endure it and to maintain a total indifference in the
eyes, even, perhaps, to foster the samyak gaze, this capacity for remaining speechless,
inactive, powerless, and immobile, and yet to survive without complaint . . . this can surely
only be found in an Easterner!
Come, come closer. I have lied to his parents; I have told them that you are a doctor.
Look . . . their faith in you shows in their eyes. There is intimacy, kindliness, and
gratitude in their eyes, as if your coming here were preordained. That smile you
described is on their faces, as if you were their eldest son who has brought a liferestoring remedy across the seven seas for your brother. The old peasant woman is
smiling, isn't she? It's as if she's rejoicing at the birth of her first grandchild from your
wife, the beauty of the world. I know that this same smile will remain on their faces
English: Grade 12

221

as long as you are here. I know that it will be extinguished when you turn to go. Once
you've gone they'll sink back into the same old darkness.
The child has a sister whose body functions properly. He watches her as she crawls
around, picking up everything she comes across and putting it into her mouth, knocking
over the beer, overturning the cooking stone. Just for an instant, the ambition to emulate
her is reflected in his eyes, but then it is reabsorbed into the same old indifference.
Once his mother was scolding his sister, and a light gleamed in his eyes. I couldn't
tell you to which era its vision belonged, but I realized that he wanted to speak. With
a gaze devoid of language, gesture, or voice, he wanted to say, "Mother, how can you
appreciate what fun it is to fall over? To crawl through the green dub grass and rub the
skin off your knees, to shed a couple of drops of blood like smeared tears, and graze
your flesh a little. To feel pain and to cry, to call out for help. That pain would be such
a sweet experience. She can rub her snot or spittle into her own grazes, or pull out
the thorn that has pricked her, and throw it away. Or she could pull off a scab that has
healed over a buried splinter of glass or spend a few days resting under her quilt. She
can climb up onto the storage jar to try to pull a picture down from the wall, and when
the peg slips out and the picture falls and the glass smashes with a wonderful noise,
she feels a wave of fear as she realizes her guilt. She has grown up, learning from
experience the facts that fire can burn her and water makes her wet, that nettles cause
blisters and beer makes her dizzy. That if she falls she might be hurt or break a bone
that if something else falls it will probably break. That if someone dies, she is able
to weep, and if someone laughs, she can laugh right back; if someone makes fun of
her, she can strike them, and if someone steals from her, she can steal from them. My
sister, who learns arid remembers each and every new word she hears, is the result of
the self-sacrificing practice of thousands of years of human language. She embodies a
history, a tradition, and a culture, and it is in her very ability to speak that the future is
born. But not in one like me, who cannot even move his lips. In my body, in its strength
and gestures, an unbroken cycle of historical and human development has come to its
conclusion. A long labor, a chain of events, a lengthy endeavor, and an endlessness are
all at an end. The future ends and is broken abruptly."
And these are the eyes, my guest, that look at you but see nothing; this is the gaze that is
incapable of self-manifestation. This is beauty that is complete and has no other expression.
These are eyes surrounded by mountains; their lashes are rows of fields where rice
ripens in the rains and wheat ripens in the winter.
These are the eyes that welcome you, and these are eyes that build. And in these eyes
hides the end of life. Look! They are just as beautiful as the setting sun's reflection in
the eyes of the Buddha!

A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings
Gabriel Garcia Marquez

Before reading
Discuss the following questions.
a.
Have you ever visited a place to see something strange or unusual? If yes, what
is it?
b.
How do clever people take advantage of common people’s gullibility?
Gabriel Garcia Marquez (1927-2014) was Colombian-born
Spanish American journalist, novelist, and short story writer.
He is regarded as the literary volcano of the nineteen sixties
and an exponent of a new narrative style known as magical
realism. His novel One Hundred Years of Solitude (1967) is
taken as a classical example of magical realism. Marquez
is one of the best novelists of world literature and perhaps
the best in Spanish literature. For many readers, Gabriel
Garcia Marquez and magical realism as synonymous with
each other. Magical Realism is a mode of narrative in which real and fantastic, natural
and supernatural, are coherently represented in a state of equivalence. Marquez’s
other best-known novels are No One Writes to the Colonel (1961), Love in the Time of
Cholera (1985), and Memories of my Melancholy Whores (2004). The story ‘A Very
Old Man with Enormous Wings’ was first published in 1955.
‘A Very Old Man with Enormous Wings’ is a magical realist story which examines
the human response to those who are weak, dependent, and different. The story shows
human nature-related curiosity, greed and cruelty.
On the third day of rain, they had killed so many crabs inside the house that Pelayo
had to cross his drenched courtyard and throw them into the sea, because the
newborn child had a temperature all night and they thought it was due to the
stench. The world had been sad since Tuesday. Sea and sky were a single ashgray thing and the sands of the beach, which on March nights glimmered like
powdered light, had become a stew of mud and rotten shellfish. The light was so
weak at noon that when Pelayo was coming back to the house after throwing away
the crabs, it was hard for him to see what it was that was moving and groaning in
the rear of the courtyard. He had to go very close to see that it was an old man, a
very old man, lying face down in the mud, who, in spite of his tremendous efforts,
couldn't get up, and impeded by his enormous wings.
Frightened by that nightmare, Pelayo ran to get Elisenda, his wife, who was putting
224

English: Grade 12

compresses on the sick child, and he took her to the rear of the courtyard. They both
looked at the fallen body with a mute stupor. He was dressed like a ragpicker. There
were only a few faded hairs left on his bald skull and very few teeth in his mouth, and
his pitiful condition of a drenched great-grandfather took away and sense of grandeur
he might have had. His huge buzzard wings, dirty and half-plucked were forever
entangled in the mud. They looked at him so long and so closely that Pelayo and
Elisenda very soon overcame their surprise and in the end found him familiar. Then
they dared speak to him, and he answered in an incomprehensible dialect with a strong
sailor's voice. That was how they skipped over the inconvenience of the wings and
quite intelligently concluded that he was a lonely castaway from some foreign ship
wrecked by the storm. And yet, they called in a neighbor woman who knew everything
about life and death to see him, and all she needed was one look to show them their
mistake.
"He's an angel," she told them. "He must have been coming for the child, but the poor
fellow is so old that the rain knocked him down."
On the following day, everyone knew that a flesh-and-blood angel was held captive in
Pelayo's house. Against the judgment of the wise neighbor woman, for whom angels
in those times were the fugitive survivors of a spiritual conspiracy, they did not have
the heart to club him to death. Pelayo watched over him all afternoon from the kitchen,
armed with his bailiff's club, and before going to bed he dragged him out of the mud
and locked him up with the hens in the wire chicken coop. In the middle of the night,
when the rain stopped, Pelayo and Elisenda were still killing crabs. A short time
afterward the child woke up without a fever and with a desire to eat. Then they felt
magnanimous and decided to put the angel on a raft with fresh water and provisions
for three days and leave him to his fate on the high seas. But when they went out into
the courtyard with the first light of dawn, they found the whole neighborhood in front
of the chicken coop having fun with the angel, without the slightest reverence, tossing
him things to eat through the openings in the wire as if weren't a supernatural creature
but a circus animal.
Father Gonzaga arrived before seven o'clock, alarmed at the strange news. By
that time onlookers less frivolous than those at dawn had already arrived and they
were making all kinds of conjectures concerning the captive's future. The simplest
among them thought that he should be named mayor of the world. Others of sterner
mind felt that he should be promoted to the rank of five-star general in order to win
all wars. Some visionaries hoped that he could be put to stud in order to implant the
earth a race of winged wise men who could take charge of the universe. But Father
Gonzaga, before becoming a priest, had been a robust woodcutter. Standing by
the wire, he reviewed his catechism in an instant and asked them to open the door
so that he could take a close look at that pitiful man who looked more like a huge
decrepit hen among the fascinated chickens. He was lying in the corner drying his
English: Grade 12

225

open wings in the sunlight among the fruit peels and breakfast leftovers that the
early risers had thrown him. Alien to the impertinences of the world, he only lifted
his antiquarian eyes and murmured something in his dialect when Father Gonzaga
went into the chicken coop and said good morning to him in Latin. The parish
priest had his first suspicion of an imposter when he saw that he did not understand
the language of God or know how to greet His ministers. Then he noticed that seen
close up he was much too human: he had an unbearable smell of the outdoors, the
back side of his wings was strewn with parasites and his main feathers had been
mistreated by terrestrial winds, and nothing about him measured up to the proud
dignity of angels. Then he came out of the chicken coop and in a brief sermon
warned the curious against the risks of being ingenuous. He reminded them that
the devil had the bad habit of making use of carnival tricks in order to confuse the
unwary. He argued that if wings were not the essential element in determining the
different between a hawk and an airplane, they were even less so in the recognition
of angels. Nevertheless, he promised to write a letter to his bishop so that the latter
would write his primate so that the latter would write to the Supreme Pontiff in
order to get the final verdict from the highest courts.
His prudence fell on sterile hearts. The news of the captive angel spread with such
rapidity that after a few hours the courtyard had the bustle of a marketplace and they
had to call in troops with fixed bayonets to disperse the mob that was about to knock
the house down. Elisenda, her spine all twisted from sweeping up so much marketplace
trash, then got the idea of fencing in the yard and charging five cents admission to see
the angel.
The curious came from far away. A traveling carnival arrived with a flying acrobat
who buzzed over the crowd several times, but no one paid any attention to him because
his wings were not those of an angel but, rather, those of a sidereal bat. The most
unfortunate invalids on earth came in search of health: a poor woman who since
childhood has been counting her heartbeats and had run out of numbers; a Portuguese
man who couldn't sleep because the noise of the stars disturbed him; a sleepwalker
who got up at night to undo the things he had done while awake; and many others
with less serious ailments. In the midst of that shipwreck disorder that made the earth
tremble, Pelayo and Elisenda were happy with fatigue, for in less than a week they had
crammed their rooms with money and the line of pilgrims waiting their turn to enter
still reached beyond the horizon.
The angel was the only one who took no part in his own act. He spent his time
trying to get comfortable in his borrowed nest, befuddled by the hellish heat of
the oil lamps and sacramental candles that had been placed along the wire. At first
they tried to make him eat some mothballs, which, according to the wisdom of the
wise neighbor woman, were the food prescribed for angels. But he turned them
down, just as he turned down the papal lunches that the pentinents brought him,
226

English: Grade 12

and they never found out whether it was because he was an angel or because he was
an old man that in the end ate nothing but eggplant mush. His only supernatural
virtue seemed to be patience. Especially during the first days, when the hens
pecked at him, searching for the stellar parasites that proliferated in his wings, and
the cripples pulled out feathers to touch their defective parts with, and even the
most merciful threw stones at him, trying to get him to rise so they could see him
standing. The only time they succeeded in arousing him was when they burned
his side with an iron for branding steers, for he had been motionless for so many
hours that they thought he was dead. He awoke with a start, ranting in his hermetic
language and with tears in his eyes, and he flapped his wings a couple of times,
which brought on a whirlwind of chicken dung and lunar dust and a gale of panic
that did not seem to be of this world. Although many thought that his reaction had
not been one of rage but of pain, from then on they were careful not to annoy him,
because the majority understood that his passivity was not that of her taking his
ease but that of a cataclysm in repose.
Father Gonzaga held back the crowd's frivolity with formulas of maidservant inspiration
while awaiting the arrival of a final judgment on the nature of the captive. But the
mail from Rome showed no sense of urgency. They spent their time finding out in the
prisoner had a navel, if his dialect had any connection with Aramaic, how many times
he could fit on the head of a pin, or whether he wasn't just a Norwegian with wings.
Those meager letters might have come and gone until the end of time if a providential
event had not put an end to the priest's tribulations.
It so happened that during those days, among so many other carnival attractions,
there arrived in the town the traveling show of the woman who had been changed
into a spider for having disobeyed her parents. The admission to see her was not
only less than the admission to see the angel, but people were permitted to ask
her all manner of questions about her absurd state and to examine her up and
down so that no one would ever doubt the truth of her horror. She was a frightful
tarantula the size of a ram and with the head of a sad maiden. What was most
heartrending, however, was not her outlandish shape but the sincere affliction with
which she recounted the details of her misfortune. While still practically a child
she had sneaked out of her parents' house to go to a dance, and while she was
coming back through the woods after having danced all night without permission,
a fearful thunderclap rent the sky in tow and through the crack came the lightning
bolt of brimstone that changed her into a spider. Her only nourishment came from
the meatballs that charitable souls chose to toss into her mouth. A spectacle like
that, full of so much human truth and with such a fearful lesson, was bound to
defeat without even trying that of a haughty angel who scarcely deigned to look at
mortals. Besides, the few miracles attributed to the angel showed a certain mental
disorder, like the blind man who didn't recover his sight but grew three new teeth,
English: Grade 12

227

or the paralytic who didn't get to walk but almost won the lottery, and the leper
whose sores sprouted sunflowers. Those consolation miracles, which were more
like mocking fun, had already ruined the angel's reputation when the woman who
had been changed into a spider finally crushed him completely. That was how
Father Gonzaga was cured forever of his insomnia and Pelayo's courtyard went
back to being as empty as during the time it had rained for three days and crabs
walked through the bedrooms.
The owners of the house had no reason to lament. With the money they saved
they built a two-story mansion with balconies and gardens and high netting so
that crabs wouldn't get in during the winter, and with iron bars on the windows so
that angels wouldn't get in. Pelayo also set up a rabbit warren close to town and
have up his job as a bailiff for good, and Elisenda bought some satin pumps with
high heels and many dresses of iridescent silk, the kind worn on Sunday by the
most desirable women in those times. The chicken coop was the only thing that
didn't receive any attention. If they washed it down with creolin and burned tears
of myrrh inside it every so often, it was not in homage to the angel but to drive
away the dungheap stench that still hung everywhere like a ghost and was turning
the new house into an old one. At first, when the child learned to walk, they were
careful that he not get too close to the chicken coop. But then they began to lose
their fears and got used to the smell, and before the child got his second teeth he'd
gone inside the chicken coop to play, where the wires were falling apart. The angel
was no less standoffish with him than with the other mortals, but he tolerated the
most ingenious infamies with the patience of a dog who had no illusions. They
both came down with the chicken pox at the same time. The doctor who took care
of the child couldn't resist the temptation to listen to the angel's heart, and he found
so much whistling in the heart and so many sounds in his kidneys that it seemed
impossible for him to be alive. What surprised him most, however, was the logic
of his wings. They seemed so natural on that completely human organism that he
couldn't understand why other men didn't have them too.
When the child began school it had been some time since the sun and rain had caused
the collapse of the chicken coop. The angel went dragging himself about here and there
like a stray dying man. They would drive him out of the bedroom with a broom and a
moment later find him in the kitchen. He seemed to be in so many places at the same
time that they grew to think that he'd be duplicated, that he was reproducing himself
all through the house, and the exasperated and unhinged Elisenda shouted that it was
awful living in that hell full of angels. He could scarcely eat and his antiquarian eyes
had also become so foggy that he went about bumping into posts. All he had left were
the bare cannulae of his last feathers. Pelayo threw a blanket over him and extended
him the charity of letting him sleep in the shed, and only then did they notice that
he had a temperature at night, and was delirious with the tongue twisters of an old
228

English: Grade 12

Norwegian. That was one of the few times they became alarmed, for they thought he
was going to die and not even the wise neighbor woman had been able to tell them
what to do with dead angels.
And yet he not only survived his worst winter, but seemed improved with the first
sunny days. He remained motionless for several days in the farthest corner of the
courtyard, where no one would see him, and at the beginning of December some large,
stiff feathers began to grow on his wings, the feathers of a scarecrow, which looked
more like another misfortune of decrepitude. But he must have known the reason for
those changes, for he was quite careful that no one should notice them that no one
should hear the sea chanteys that he sometimes sang under the stars. One morning
Elisenda was cutting some bunches of onions for lunch when a wind that seemed
to come from the high seas blew into the kitchen. Then she went to the window and
caught the angel in his first attempts at flight. They were so clumsy that his fingernails
opened a furrow in the vegetable patch and he was on the point of knocking the shed
down with the ungainly flapping that slipped on the light and couldn't get a grip on the
air. But he did manage to gain altitude. Elisenda let out a sigh of relief, for herself and
for him, when she watched him pass over the last houses, holding himself up in some
way with the risky flapping of a senile vulture. She kept watching him even when
she was through cutting the onions and she kept on watching until it was no longer
possible for her to see him, because then he was no longer an annoyance in her life but
an imaginary dot on the horizon of the sea.

This story belongs to the genre of ‘magical realism’, a genre perfected by
Gabriel Garcia Marquez in his novels and short stories. Magical realism is a
narrative technique in which the story-teller narrates the common place things
with magical colour and the events look both magical and real at the same time.
Collect five magic realist happenings from the story and argue why they seem
magical to you.

A Day
Emily Dickinson

Before reading
Answer the following questions.
a.
What kind of day do you like: rainy, sunny or foggy? Why?
b.
How does the sun tell us about different stages of a day?
One of the most eminent American poets from the nineteenth
century, Emily Dickinson’s (1830-1886) poetry was heavily
influenced by the Metaphysical poets of seventeenth-century
England, as well as her reading of the Book of Revelation and her
upbringing in a Puritan New England town. These upbringings
inculcated in her Calvinist, orthodox, and conservative approach
to Christianity. Dickinson and Walt Whitman are considered the
founders of a uniquely American poetic voice. While Dickinson
was extremely prolific as a poet her regularly enclosed poems in
letters to friends she was not publicly recognized during her lifetime. However, she has
been steadily gaining popularity through her posthumously published poems.
In her poem “A Day”, Dickinson, through the use of brilliant imageries and symbols,
describes a beautiful day that leads the children from innocence to experience.
I’ll tell you how the sun rose, ___
A ribbon at a time.
The steeples swam in amethyst,
The news like squirrels ran.
The hills untied their bonnets,
The bobolinks begun.
Then I said softly to myself,
“That must have been the sun!”
But how he set, I know not.
There seemed a purple stile
Which little yellow boys and girls
Were climbing all the while

Every Morning I Wake
Dylan Thomas

Before reading
Answer the following questions.
a.
Why do people offer prayers to the God?
b.
What do you feel when you visit the mosque, temple, or church? Why do you
feel so?
Born in Swansea, Wales, Dylan Thomas (19141953) is famous for his acutely lyrical and emotional
poetry. Thomas can be seen as an extension into
the 20th century of the general movement called
Romanticism, that flourished in the nineteenth century
Englnad, particularly in its emphasis on imagination,
emotion, intuition, spontaneity, and organic form.
Considered to be one of the greatest Welsh poets of
all time, Thomas is largely known for his imaginative
use of language and vivid imagery in his poems. He
started working for BBC in 1945. Under Milk Wood
(1953), a radio play, was written over a long period of
time during the last months of his life. It is set in a small Welsh town called Llareggub
and covers one day in the lives of its provincial characters.
“Every Morning I Wake” is an extract from Under the Milk Wood. In this poem,
Thomas prays to the magnificent God to have mercy on ordinary inhabitants living
under the Milk Wood.
Every morning when I wake,
Dear Lord, a little prayer I make,
O please do keep Thy loving eye
On all poor creatures born to die
And every evening at sun-down
I ask a blessing on the town,
For whether we last the night or no
I’m sure is always touch-and-go.
234

English: Grade 12

We are not wholly bad or good
Who live our lives under Milk Wood,
And Thou, I know, wilt be the first
To see our best side, not our worst.
O let us see another day!
Bless us all this night, I pray,
And to the sun we all will bow
And say, good-bye – but just for now!

I Was My Own Route
Julia de Burgos

Before reading
Discuss the following questions.
a.
Do you try to be like what others want you to be? Why? Why not?
b.
How can we achieve our identity?
Born in Carolina, Puerto Rico, Julia de Burgos (1914-1953)
moved to New York, where she worked as a journalist, and then
Cuba, where she pursued further studies at the University of
Havana. Returning to New York after two years in Cuba, de
Burgos, a freedom fighter, served as the art and culture editor
for the progressive newspaper Pueblos Hispanos. Predating
the Nuyorican poetry movement, de Burgos’ poems deal with
themes of women’s liberation and social justice.
A precursor to the contemporary Latina/o writers, de Burgos,
in her poem “I was my Own Route,” depicts how the women
are burdened with the patriarchal ideologies from the past.
Therefore, de Burgos urges the women to detach themselves from the past so as to
locate their identity within.
I wanted to be like men wanted me to be:
an attempt at life;
a game of hide and seek with my being.
But I was made of nows,
and my feet level on the promissory earth
would not accept walking backwards
and went forward, forward,
mocking the ashes to reach the kiss
of new paths.
At each advancing step on my route forward
my back was ripped by the desperate flapping wings
of the old guard.
236

English: Grade 12

But the branch was unpinned forever,
and at each new whiplash my look
separated more and more and more from the distant
familiar horizons;
and my face took the expansion that came from within,
the defined expression that hinted at a feeling
of intimate liberation;
a feeling that surged
from the balance between my life
and the truth of the kiss of the new paths.
Already my course now set in the present,
I felt myself a blossom of all the soils of the earth,
of the soils without history,
of the soils without a future,
of the soil always soil without edges
of all the men and all the epochs.
And I was all in me as was life in me .. . .
I wanted to be like men wanted me to be:
an attempt at life;
a game of hide and seek with my being.
But I was made of nows;
when the heralds announced me
at the regal parade of the old guard,
the desire to follow men warped in me,
and the homage was left waiting for me.. . . . . . . . . .

Glossary
promissory (adj.): containing or conveying a promise
whiplash (n.): a blow with a whip

The Awakening Age
Ben Okri

Before reading
Discuss the following questions.
a.
Why do you think people from your country migrate to another country?
b.
Do people from other countries migrate to your country? Why?
A winner of Man Booker prize for his
novel The Famished Road, the Nigerian
poet, fiction writer, and essayist Ben
Okri (1949-) spent his early childhood
in London. Informed by folk tales and
dream logic, Okri’s writing also treats his
family’s experience of the Nigerian civil
war. In an interview for The National,
Okri stated, “I grew up in a tradition where
there are simply more dimensions to
reality: legends and myths and ancestors
and spirits and death. You can't use Jane
Austen to speak about African reality.
Which brings the question: what is reality? Everyone's reality is different. For different
perceptions of reality we need a different language.”
A prolific poet and story teller, Okri, like in his other works, portrays the hardships
of the African people in “The Awakening Age”. In addition, he makes a call for unity,
peace and solidarity among human beings from different parts of the world.
O ye who travel the meridian line,
May the vision of a new world within you shine.
May eyes that have lived with poverty's rage,
See through to the glory of the awakening age.
For we are all richly linked in hope,
Woven in history, like a mountain rope.
Together we can ascend to a new height,
Guided by our heart's clearest light.
English: Grade 12

239

When perceptions are changed there's much to gain,
A flowering of truth instead of pain.
There's more to a people than their poverty;
There's their work, wisdom, and creativity.
Along the line may our lives rhyme,
To make a loving harvest of space and time.

Soft Storm
Abhi Subedi

Before reading
Answer the following questions.
a.
Have you ever grown sad/happy observing things around you?
b.
Point out three things you are not happy about within your surroundings.
A prolific poet, playwright, and critic, Abhi
Subedi (1945) has remained one of the eminent
personalities in the field of literature in Nepal.
Born in Sabla village of Terhathum district, Subedi
has written several plays including Dreams of
Peach Blossoms (2001) and Fire in the Monastery
(2003). Subedi, who taught at the Central
Department of English, Tribhuvan University,
for around 40 years, has poetry collections like
Manas (1974) and Chasing Dreams: Kathmandu
Odyssey (1996) and Shabdara Chot (1997) to his
credit.
In the present poem entitled “Soft Storm,” Subedi,
with a touch of compassion, contemplates over the absurdities of tumultuous times.
I became soft
I became soft
after I heard the tumult and
crashed on the eerie stillness;
I inherited the soft
when the sky grew like crocuses
over stones and
became five inches taller
that very night
when moon skidded down
your walls
English: Grade 12

241

speaking in the language
of posters and politics
rituals and reasons.
I became soft
as the softness rose like a gale
tearing my roofs
that very night
when the moon sang of
lampposts and gutters
in this seamless city.
I became soft
when homeless children in Thamel
cried with hunger under the bat-bearing
trees of Kesharmahal;
I became soft
when I returned
from the melee
where ceremony
dances with mad steps
on the unwedded gardens of history
growing around protruded rocks.
I became soft
when I alone turned to you
leaving deep dents of words
on these white sheets;
I became soft storm
when I saw a forlorn child
carrying transistor radio around his neck
run around wailing
to find his mother
in the corridors of violent history.
242

English: Grade 12

I became a soft storm
when I saw a man
beaten mercilessly
for no reason
before his family
by nobody for no reason
in no sensible times.
I became soft
when I saw
a blood-stained shirt
speaking in the earth’s ears
with bruised human lips
in the far corner
under the moon
of history and dreams
playing hide and seek
in open museums
of human times.
I became soft
since you gave words
but did not listen to them,
gave storms
but didn’t wait to see its Leela
over the silent stone.
Crocuses have grown
over the stone–
I saw last moonlit night,
storms have loitered
in the narrow lanes
where I too have walked alone

243

pensively in rain tears
and little chuckles of sun laughter
that have risen and melted
like rainbow.
Soft is my storm
that rages and rages
over silent pages,
silent stones,
silent forlorn shirts carrying war memories,
silent dilapidations of gods’ abodes
where dances and songs
are buried under helpless divine debris
in human courtyards.
Soft is what you saw,
I honor your mooneyes
but the mad time spools
winding all that we see and live with,
stone growing in flower
moon humming melodies
history rushing under the lamppost
and over deforested land,
birds singing of bizarre journeys
over the warming earth
rhododendron blooming in winter,
mother earth telling of the tumults
in the songs of the sad birds.
All in unison have created
this soft gale.
But in these hard times
I want to melt like a rainbow

On Libraries
Oliver Sacks

Before reading
Answer the following questions.
a.
Why do people visit the libraries?
b.
Have you ever borrowed books from the library? If yes, what kinds of books do
you like to read?
Oliver Sacks was born in 1933 in London and was
educated at the Queen’s College, Oxford. He completed
his medical training at San Francisco’s Mount Zion
Hospital and at UCLA before moving to New York,
where he soon encountered the patients whom he
would write about in his book Awakenings. Sacks was a
neurologist and an author whose case studies of patients
with unusual disorders became best-sellers. His focus
on patients with particularly rare or dramatic problems
made his work popular with writers in other forms,
and his case studies were adapted into several different
movies and operas. Dr. Sacks spent almost fifty years working as a neurologist and
wrote a number of books--including The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat,
Musicophilia, and Hallucinations--about the strange neurological predicaments and
conditions of his patients. The New York Times referred to him as "the poet laureate of
medicine," and he received many awards, including honors from ‘The Guggenheim
Foundation,’ The National Science Foundation, The American Academy of Arts and
Letters, and The Royal College of Physicians. His memoir, On the Move, was published
shortly before his death in August 2015.
“On Libraries” is written in praise of intellectual freedom, community work, and the
ecstasy of serendipitous discovery. Among the titans of mind and spirit shaped and
saved by libraries was the great neurologist, author, and voracious reader.
When I was a child, my favorite room at home was the library, a large oak-paneled
room with all four walls covered by bookcases—and a solid table for writing and
studying in the middle. It was here that my father had his special library, as a Hebrew
scholar; here too were all of Ibsen’s plays—my parents had originally met in a medical
English: Grade 12

247

students’ Ibsen society; here, on a single shelf, were the young poets of my father’s
generation, many killed in the Great War; and here, on the lower shelves so I could
easily reach them, were the adventure and history books belonging to my three older
brothers. It was here that I found The Jungle Book; I identified deeply with Mowgli,
and used his adventures as a taking-off point for my own fantasies.
My mother had her favorite books in a separate bookcase in the lounge—Dickens,
Trollope, and Thackeray, Bernard Shaw’s plays in pale green bindings, as well as an
entire set of Kipling bound in soft morocco. There was a beautiful three-volume set
of Shakespeare’s works, a gilt-edged Milton, and other books, mostly poetry, that my
mother had got as school prizes.
Medical books were kept in a special locked cabinet in my parents’ surgery (but the
key was in the door, so it was easy to unlock).
The oak-paneled library was the quietest and most beautiful room in the house, to my
eyes, and it vied with my little lab as my favorite place to be. I would curl up in a chair
and become so absorbed in what I was reading that all sense of time would be lost.
Whenever I was late for lunch or dinner I could be found, completely absorbed by a
book, in the library. I learned to read early, at three or four, and books, and our library,
are among my first memories.
But the Ur-library, for me, was the Willesden Public Library, our own local public
library. Here I spent many of the happiest hours of my growing-up years—our house
was a five-minute walk from the library—and it was there I received my real education.
On the whole, I disliked school, sitting in class, receiving instruction; information
seemed to go in one ear and out by the other. I could not be passive—I had to be active,
learn for myself, learn what I wanted, and in the way which suited me best. I was not
a good pupil, but I was a good learner, and in Willesden Library—and all the libraries
that came later—I roamed the shelves and stacks, had the freedom to select whatever
I wanted, to follow paths which fascinated me, to become myself. At the library I felt
free—free to look at the thousands, tens of thousands, of books; free to roam and to
enjoy the special atmosphere and the quiet companionship of other readers, all, like
myself, on quests of their own.
As I got older, my reading was increasingly biased towards the sciences, especially
astronomy and chemistry. St. Paul’s School, where I went when I was twelve, had an
excellent general library, the Walker Library, which was particularly heavy in history
and politics—but it could not provide all of the science and especially chemistry books
I now hungered for. But with a special testimonial from one of the school masters, I
was able to get a ticket to the library of the Science Museum, and there I devoured
the many volumes of Mellor’s Comprehensive Treatise on Inorganic and Theoretical
Chemistry and the even-longer Gmelin’s Handbook of Inorganic Chemistry.
When I went to university, I had access to Oxford’s two great university libraries, the
Radcliffe Science Library and the Bodleian, a wonderful general library that could
248

English: Grade 12

trace itself back to 1602. It was in the Bodleian that I stumbled upon the now-obscure
and forgotten works of Theodore Hook, a man greatly admired in the early nineteenth
century for his wit and his genius for theatrical and musical improvisation (he was said
to have composed more than five hundred operas on the spot). I became so fascinated
by Hook that I decided to write a sort of biography or “case-history” of him. No other
library—apart from the British Museum Library—could have provided the materials
I needed, and the tranquil atmosphere of the Bodleian was a perfect one in which to
write.
But the library I most loved at Oxford was our own library at the Queen’s College. The
magnificent library building itself had been designed by Christopher Wren, and beneath
this, in an underground maze of heating pipes and shelves, were the vast subterranean
holdings of the library. To hold ancient books, incunabula, in my own hands was a new
experience for me—I particularly adored Gesner’s HistoriaeAnimalium (1551), richly
illustrated with Dürer’s drawing of a rhinoceros and Agassiz’s four-volume work
on fossil fishes. It was there, too, that I saw all of Darwin’s works in their original
editions, and it was in the stacks that I found and fell in love with all the works of
Sir Thomas Browne—his Religio Medici, his Hydrotaphia, and The Garden of Cyrus
(The Quincunciall Lozenge). How absurd some of these were, but how magnificent the
language! And if Browne’s classical magniloquence became too much at times, one
could switch to the lapidary cut-and-thrust of Swift—all of whose works, of course,
were there in their original editions. While I had grown up on the nineteenth-century
works that my parents favored, it was the catacombs of the Queen’s library that
introduced me to seventeenth- and eighteenth-century literature—John-son, Hume,
Pope, and Dryden. All of these books were freely available, not in some special,
locked-away rare books enclave, but just sitting on the shelves, as they had done (I
imagined) since their original publication. It was in the vaults of the Queen’s College
that I really gained a sense of history, and of my own language.
I first came to New York City in 1965, and at that time I had a horrid, pokey little
apartment in which there were almost no surfaces to read or write on. I was just
able, holding an elbow awkwardly aloft, to write some of Migraine on the top of the
refrigerator. I longed for spaciousness. Fortunately, the library at the Albert Einstein
College of Medicine, where I worked, had this in abundance. I would sit at a large table
to read or write for a while, and then wander around the shelves and stacks. I never
knew what my eyes might alight upon, but I would sometimes discover unexpected
treasures, lucky finds, and bring these back to my seat.
Though the library was quiet, whispered conversations might start in the stacks—
two of you, perhaps, were searching for the same old book, the same bound volumes
of Brain from 1890—and conversations could lead to friendships. All of us in the
library were reading our own books, absorbed in our own worlds, and yet there was a
sense of community, even intimacy. The physicality of books—along with their places
English: Grade 12

249

and their neighbors on the bookshelves—was part of this camaraderie: handling books,
sharing them, passing them between us, even seeing the names of previous readers and
the dates they took books out.
But a shift was occurring by the 1990s. I would continue to visit the library frequently,
sitting at a table with a mountain of books in front of me, but students increasingly
ignored the bookshelves, accessing what they needed with their computers. Few of
them went to the shelves anymore. The books, so far as they were concerned, were
unnecessary. And since the majority of users were no longer using the books themselves,
the college decided, ultimately, to dispose of them.
I had no idea that this was happening—not only in the AECOM library but in college
and public libraries all over the country. I was horrified when I visited the library a
couple of months ago and found the shelves, once overflowing, sparsely occupied. Over
the last few years, most of the books, it seems, have been thrown out, with remarkably
little objection from anyone. I felt that a murder, a crime had been committed—the
destruction of centuries of knowledge. Seeing my distress, a librarian reassured me
that everything “of worth” had been digitized. But I do not use a computer, and I am

Marriage as a Social Institution
Stephen L. Nock

Before reading
Answer the following questions.
a.
What types of marriages are in practice in your culture?
b.
Do you think marriages are different from culture to culture?
Steven L. Nock (March 11, 1950 – January 26, 2008) was
a researcher, author, and the Commonwealth Professor
of Sociology at the University of Virginia. He wrote
extensively on the role of marriage in society, and worked
in the Federal Department of Health and Human Services as
a consultant on American family policy. He authored textbooks and articles about the causes and consequences of
change in the American family. He investigated issues of
privacy, unmarried fatherhood, cohabitation, commitment,
divorce, and marriage. His book, Marriage in Men's Lives
won the William J. Good Book Award from the American Sociological Association for
the most outstanding contribution to family scholarship in 1999.
In this essay, the author examines the national marriage debate by reviewing the social
and demographic trends that have changed the role of marriage and the family. He
views that marriage and parenthood are private matters, relevant only to the individuals
directly involved.
He points out the programs that have strengthened marital relationships, lowered
divorce rates, reduced out-of-wedlock births, and encouraged responsible fatherhood.
A marriage is much more than the sum of two spouses. It is also a relationship
defined by legal, moral, and conventional assumptions. While one can imagine
a variety of close personal affiliations uniting two adults, the variety of marriage
affiliations is much narrower because marriage is an institution, culturally
patterned and integrated into other basic social institutions, such as education,
the economy, and politics. Marriage has rules that originate outside any particular
union of two spouses and that establish soft boundaries around the relationship
that influence the partners in many ways. The boundaries around marriages are
the commonly understood allowable limits of behavior that distinguish marriage
from all other kinds of relationships. The social norms that define the institution
252

English: Grade 12

of marriage identify married spouses in ways that distinguish them from others.
Married couples have something that other couples lack: they are heirs to a vast
system of understood principles that help organize and sustain their lives.
One explanation for how marriage matters to men is that it provides structure to
their lives and organizes their ambitions. This is an old argument, first suggested a
century ago by Emile Durkheim, who demonstrated the protective role of marriage
in preventing suicide. Durkheim observed that since basic human necessities (food,
housing, clothing) are more or less available in all advanced societies, desires
among modern humans are focused on well-being, comfort, luxury, and prestige.
Sooner or later, however, the appetite for such rewards becomes sated. One of the
central problems in modern society, therefore, is establishing legitimate boundaries
around such desires. This, Durkheim believed, can be accomplished only by social
institutions such as marriage.
Durkheim explained the function of marriage for men by noting how unrestrained
longings and desires must be checked. Marriage benefits men, Durkheim believed,
because, as an organ of society, it restrains their otherwise uncontrollable impulses.
Discussing such desires and impulses, Durkheim observed:
By forcing a man to attach himself forever to the same woman, marriage
assigns a strictly definite object to the need for love, and closes the horizon.
This determination is what forms the state of moral equilibrium from which the
husband benefits. Being unable to seek other satisfactions than those permitted,
without transgressing his duty, he restricts his desires to them. The salutary
discipline to which he is subjected makes it his duty to find his happiness in his
lot, and by doing so supplies him with the means. (1951: 270-71)
Two people may enjoy a harmonious and happy life without the benefit of marriage.
In fact, growing numbers of Americans appear to believe that unmarried cohabitation
offers something that marriage does not: freedom from the rules of marriage because
there are no widely accepted and approved boundaries around cohabitation. Unmarried
partners have tremendous freedom to decide how they will arrange their relationships.
Each partner must decide how to deal with the other's parents, for example. Couples
must decide whether vacations will be taken together or separately. Money may be
pooled or held in separate accounts.
And the parents of a cohabiting couple will also need to create a relationship with them
with little guidance. Is the cohabiting couple to be treated as a married pair? In such
small ways, cohabiting couples and their associates must create
their relationship. Married couples may also face decisions about some of these matters.
However, married spouses have a pattern to follow. For most matters of domestic life,
English: Grade 12

253

marriage supplies a template—what cohabiting couples lack. They are exempt from
the vast range of marriage norms and laws in our society.
A man can say to his spouse: "I am your husband. You are my wife. I am expected
to do certain things for you, and you likewise. We have pledged our faithfulness.
We have sworn to forego others. We have made a commitment to our children. We
have a responsibility and obligation to our close relatives, as they have to us." These
statements are not simply personal pledges. They are also enforceable. Others will
expect these things of the couple. Laws, religion, and customs bolster this contract.
When this man says to someone, "I would like you to meet my wife," this simple
declaration says a great deal.
Consider an unmarried couple living happily together. What, if any, are the conventional
assumptions that can be made? What are the limits to behavior? To whom is each
obligated? Whom can this couple count on for help in times of need? And how do you
complete this introduction of one's cohabiting partner: "I would like you to meet my
..."? The lack of a word for such a partner clearly indicates how little such relationships
are governed by convention. Alternatively, we may say that such a relationship is not
an institution.
Marriage is a form of "capital" just as surely as any other resource. "If physical capital
is wholly tangible, being embodied in observable material form, and human capital
is less tangible, being embodied in skills and knowledge acquired by an individual,
social capital is less tangible yet, for it exists in the relations among persons. Just as
physical capital and human capital facilitate productive activity, social capital does as
well" (Coleman, 1988: S100-S101). Social capital consists of extensive networks of
individuals linked by bonds of trustworthiness and trust.
This type of capital is produced in relationships predicated on the belief (i.e., trust)
that obligations will be incurred and repaid. Through their marriages, husbands and
wives become connected to new kin (and friends of new kin). Kinship ties forged
through marriage differ from those in more casual relationships. Such relationships
are extensively woven with threads of obligations. In times of need, one may call
upon relatives and expect assistance. The enduring nature of kinship obligations
means that such debts persist and bind relatives together in an ongoing relationship.
Social capital also embeds individuals in networks that channel valued knowledge
and information among all members. Such networks are sustained by social norms
and social sanctions (honor, status, etc.) that facilitate certain actions and constrain
others. Individuals benefit just as much from the accumulation of social capital as from
other types of capital. Yet social capital cannot be separated from the configuration of
institutions and communities (other people) that give it meaning and consequence. In
254

English: Grade 12

short, the institution of marriage is an individual asset. Although intangible, it is no
less important than other assets, yet more difficult to sustain (or accumulate) because
it exists only as relationships with others.
The soft boundaries of marriage distinguish it qualitatively from all other forms of
relationships. Therefore, to understand how marriage affects spouses, one must
consider the various rules that define it. Thus, it would be well to reemphasize here
the six dimensions that define normative marriage in America: marriages are entered
voluntarily by mature, heterosexual adults with the expectation that husbands will be
the principal earners, that both partners will be sexually
faithful, and that married partners will become parents. Although many marriages
depart from these ideals, the ideals still constitute the core of normative marriage as
it is expressed in law, religion, and custom. Normative marriage is a form of social
control, a way by which behaviors and aspirations are channeled appropriately. It
is a force greater than the individuals involved because it represents the collective
sentiments of others. Marriage in this view is qualitatively different from other intimate
relationships. Much of the meaning of marriage in men's lives will be found in these
rules. Together, these six premises provide a definition of marriage that will inform the
rest of this work.

Knowledge and Wisdom
Bertrand Russell

Before reading
Discuss the following questions.
a.
What are the differences between a learned man and a wise man?
b.
Why do you think some knowledgeable people are not wise?
Bertrand Arthur William Russell (1872–1970) was
a British philosopher, logician, essayist and social
critic best known for his work in mathematical
logic and analytic philosophy. His most influential
contributions include his championing of logicism
(the view that mathematics is in some important sense
reducible to logic), his refining of Gottlob Frege’s
predicate calculus (which still forms the basis of most
contemporary systems of logic), his defense of neutral
monism (the view that the world consists of just
one type of substance which is neither exclusively
mental nor exclusively physical), and his theories of definite descriptions, logical
atomism and logical types.
In this essay, Russell differentiates between knowledge and wisdom. Knowledge and
wisdom are different things. According to him, knowledge is defined as the acquisition
of data and information, while wisdom is defined as the practical application and use
of the knowledge to create value. Wisdom is gained through learning and practical
experience, not just memorization.
Most people would agree that, although our age far surpasses all previous ages in
knowledge, there has been no correlative increase in wisdom. But agreement ceases as
soon as we attempt to define `wisdom' and consider means of promoting it. I want to
ask first what wisdom is, and then what can be done to teach it.
There are, I think, several factors that contribute to wisdom. Of these, I should put first a
sense of proportion: the capacity to take account of all the important factors in a problem
and to attach to each its due weight. This has become more difficult than it used to be owing
to the extent and complexity for the specialized knowledge required of various kinds of
technicians. Suppose, for example, that you are engaged in research in scientific medicine.
The work is difficult and is likely to absorb the whole of your intellectual energy. You have
not time to consider the effect which your discoveries or inventions may have outside
the field of medicine. You succeed (let us say), as modern medicine has succeeded, in
enormously lowering the infant death-rate, not only in Europe and America, but also in Asia
English: Grade 12

257

and Africa. This has the entirely unintended result of making the food supply inadequate
and lowering the standard of life in the most populous parts of the world. To take an even
more spectacular example, which is in everybody's mind at the present time: You study the
composition of the atom from a disinterested desire for knowledge, and incidentally place
in the hands of powerful lunatics the means of destroying the human race. In such ways
the pursuit of knowledge may become harmful unless it is combined with wisdom; and
wisdom in the sense of comprehensive vision is not necessarily present in specialists in the
pursuit of knowledge.
Comprehensiveness alone, however, is not enough to constitute wisdom. There must
be, also, a certain awareness of the ends of human life. This may be illustrated by the
study of history. Many eminent historians have done more harm than good because
they viewed facts through the distorting medium of their own passions. Hegel had
a philosophy of history which did not suffer from any lack of comprehensiveness,
since it started from the earliest times and continued into an indefinite future. But the
chief lesson of history which he sought to inculcate was that from the year 400AD
down to his own time Germany had been the most important nation and the standardbearer of progress in the world. Perhaps one could stretch the comprehensiveness that
constitutes wisdom to include not only intellect but also feeling. It is by no means
uncommon to find men whose knowledge is wide but whose feelings are narrow. Such
men lack what I call wisdom.
It is not only in public ways, but in private life equally, that wisdom is needed. It is
needed in the choice of ends to be pursued and in emancipation from personal prejudice.
Even an end which it would be noble to pursue if it were attainable may be pursued
unwisely if it is inherently impossible of achievement. Many men in past ages devoted
their lives to a search for the philosopher's stone and the elixir of life. No doubt, if they
could have found them, they would have conferred great benefits upon mankind, but
as it was their lives were wasted. To descend to less heroic matters, consider the case
of two men, Mr A and Mr B, who hate each other and, through mutual hatred, bring
each other to destruction. Suppose you go to the Mr A and say, 'Why do you hate Mr
B?' He will no doubt give you an appalling list of Mr B's vices, partly true, partly false.
And now suppose you go to Mr B. He will give you an exactly similar list of Mr A's
vices with an equal admixture of truth and falsehood. Suppose you now come back to
Mr A and say,
'You will be surprised to learn that Mr B says the same things about you as you say about
him', and you go to Mr B and make a similar speech. The first effect, no doubt, will be to
increase their mutual hatred, since each will be so horrified by the other's injustice.
But perhaps, if you have sufficient patience and sufficient persuasiveness, you
may succeed in convincing each that the other has only the normal share of human
wickedness, and that their enmity is harmful to both. If you can do this, you will have
instilled some fragment of wisdom.
258

English: Grade 12

I think the essence of wisdom is emancipation, as fat as possible, from the tyranny
of the here and now. We cannot help the egoism of our senses. Sight and sound and
touch are bound up with our own bodies and cannot be impersonal. Our emotions start
similarly from ourselves. An infant feels hunger or discomfort, and is unaffected except
by his own physical condition. Gradually with the years, his horizon widens, and, in
proportion as his thoughts and feelings become less personal and less concerned with
his own physical states, he achieves growing wisdom. This is of course a matter of
degree. No one can view the world with complete impartiality; and if anyone could, he
would hardly be able to remain alive. But it is possible to make a continual approach
towards impartiality, on the one hand, by knowing things somewhat remote in time or
space, and on the other hand, by giving to such things their due weight in our feelings.
It is this approach towards impartiality that constitutes growth in wisdom.
Can wisdom in this sense be taught? And, if it can, should the teaching of it be one of the
aims of education? I should answer both these questions in the affirmative. We are told on
Sundays that we should love our neighbors as ourselves. On the other six days of the week,
we are exhorted to hate. But you will remember that the precept was exemplified by saying
that the Samaritan was our neighbour. We no longer have any wish to hate Samaritans
and so we are apt to miss the point of the parable. If you want to get its point, you should
substitute Communist or anti-Communist, as the case may be, for Samaritan.
It might be objected that it is right to hate those who do harm. I do not think so. If
you hate them, it is only too likely that you will become equally harmful; and it is
very unlikely that you will induce them to abandon their evil ways. Hatred of evil is
itself a kind of bondage to evil. The way out is through understanding, not through
hate. I am not advocating non-resistance. But I am saying that resistance, if it is to be
effective in preventing the spread of evil, should be combined with the greatest degree
of understanding and the smallest degree of force that is compatible with the survival
of the good things that we wish to preserve.
It is commonly urged that a point of view such as I have been advocating is incompatible
with vigour in action. I do not think history bears out this view. Queen Elizabeth I
in England and Henry IV in France lived in a world where almost everybody was
fanatical, either on the Protestant or on the Catholic side. Both remained free from
the errors of their time and both, by remaining free, were beneficent and certainly not
ineffective. Abraham Lincoln conducted a great war without ever departing from what
I have called wisdom.
I have said that in some degree wisdom can be taught. I think that this teaching should have
a larger intellectual element than has been customary in what has been thought of as moral
instruction. I think that the disastrous results of hatred and narrow-mindedness to those
who feel them can be pointed out incidentally in the course of giving knowledge. I do not
think that knowledge and morals ought to be too much separated. It is true that the kind of
specialized knowledge which is required for various kinds of skill has very little to do with
English: Grade 12

259

wisdom. But it should be supplemented in education by wider surveys calculated to put it
in its place in the total of human activities. Even the best technicians should also be good
citizens; and when I say 'citizens', I mean citizens of the world and not of this or that sect
or nation. With every increase of knowledge and skill, wisdom becomes more necessary,
for every such increase augments our capacity of realizing our purposes, and therefore
augments our capacity for evil, if our purposes are unwise. The world needs wisdom as
it has never needed it before; and if knowledge continues to increase, the world will need
wisdom in the future even more than it does now.

Humility
Yuval Noah Harari

Before reading
Answer the following questions. 		
a.
What do you know about the Chinese civilization?
c.
Are there any similarities between South Indian and Chinese civilizations? Discuss.
Prof. Yuval Noah Harari is a historian, philosopher,
and the bestselling author of Sapiens: A Brief
History of Humankind, Homo Deus: A Brief History
of Tomorrow, 21 Lessons for the 21 st Century, and
Sapiens: A Graphic History. He is a Co-founder of
Sapienship, a multidisciplinary organization advocating
for global responsibility whose mission is to clarify the
public conversation, support the quest for solutions and
focus attention on the most important challenges facing
the world today. He is now a lecturer in the Department
of History at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem.
Harari exemplifies the virtue of humility in that he debunks humanity’s illusions of
superiority and mastery. He claims morality, art, spirituality and creativity are universal
human abilities embedded in our DNA.
You are not the centre of the world
Most people tend to believe they are the centre of the world, and their culture is the
linchpin of human history. Many Greeks believe that history began with Homer,
Sophocles and Plato, and that all important ideas and inventions were born in Athens,
Sparta, Alexandria or Constantinople. Chinese nationalists retort that history really
began with the Yellow Emperor and the Xia and Shang dynasties, and that whatever
Westerners, Muslims or Indians achieved is but a pale copy of original Chinese
breakthroughs.
Hindu nativists dismiss these Chinese boasts, and argue that even airplanes and
nuclear bombs were invented by ancient sages in the Indian subcontinent long before
Confucius or Plato, not to mention Einstein and the Wright brothers. Did you know,
for example, that it was Maharishi Bhardwaj who invented rockets and aeroplanes,
that Vishwamitra not only invented but also used missiles, that Acharya Kanad was
English: Grade 12

261

the father of atomic theory, and that the Mahabharata accurately describes nuclear
weapons?
Pious Muslims regard all history prior to the Prophet Muhammad as largely
irrelevant, and they consider all history after the revelation of the Quran to revolve
around the Muslim ummah. The main exceptions are Turkish, Iranian and Egyptian
nationalists, who argue that even prior to Muhammad their particular nation was
the fountainhead of all that was good about humanity, and that even after the
revelation of the Quran, it was mainly their people who preserved the purity of
Islam and spread its glory.
Needless to say that British, French, German, American, Russian, Japanese and
countless other groups are similarly convinced that humankind would have lived in
barbarous and immoral ignorance if it wasn't for the spectacular achievements of their
nation. Some people in history went so far as to imagine that the political institutions
and religious practices were essential to the very laws of physics. Thus the Aztecs
firmly believed that without the sacrifices they performed each year, the sun would not
rise and the entire universe would disintegrate.
All these claims are false. They combine a wilful ignorance of history with more
than a hint of racism. None of the religions or nations of today existed when
humans colonised the world, domesticated plants and animals, built the first
cities, or invented writing and money. Morality, art, spirituality and creativity are
universal human abilities embedded in our DNA. Their genesis was in Stone Age
Africa. It is therefore crass egotism to ascribe to them a more recent place and
time, be they China in the age of the Yellow Emperor, Greece in the age of Plato,
or Arabia in the age of Muhammad.
Personally, I am all too familiar with such crass egotism, because the Jews, my own
people, also think that they are the most important thing in the world. Name any human
achievement or invention, and they will quickly claim credit for it. And knowing them
intimately, I also know they are genuinely convinced of such claims. I once went to a
yoga teacher in Israel, who in the introductory class explained in all seriousness that
yoga was invented by Abraham, and that all the basic yoga postures derive from the
shape of the letters of the Hebrew alphabet! (Thus the trikonasana posture imitates
the shape of the Hebrew letter aleph, tuladandasana imitates the letter daled, etc.)
Abraham taught these postures to the son of one of his concubines, who went to India
and taught yoga to the Indians. When I asked for some evidence, the master quoted
262

English: Grade 12

a biblical passage: 'And to the sons of his concubines Abraham gave gifts, and while
he was still living he sent them away from his son Isaac, eastward to the east country'
(Genesis 25:6). What do you think these gifts were? So you see, even yoga was actually
invented by the Jews.
Considering Abraham to be the inventor of yoga is a fringe notion. Yet mainstream
Judaism solemnly maintains that the entire cosmos exists just so that Jewish rabbis can
study their holy scriptures, and that if Jews cease this practice, the universe will come
to an end. China, India, Australia and even the distant galaxies will all be annihilated if
the rabbis in Jerusalem and Brooklyn stop debating the Talmud. This is a central article
of faith of Orthodox Jews, and anyone who dares doubt it is considered an ignorant
fool. Secular Jews may be a bit more sceptical about this grandiose claim, but they
too believe that the Jewish people are the central heroes of history and the ultimate
wellspring of human morality, spirituality and learning.
What my people lack in numbers and real influence, they more than compensate
for in chutzpah. Since it is more polite to criticise one's own people than to criticise
foreigners, I will use the example of Judaism to illustrate how ludicrous such selfimportant narratives are, and I will leave it to readers around the world to puncture the
hot-air balloons inflated by their own tribes.

Human Rights and the Age of Inequality

										

Samuel Moyn

Before reading
Discuss the following questions.
a.
How do you define human rights?
b.
Do you know about constitution? How does the Constitution of Nepal guarantee
the human rights?
Samuel Moyn is Jeremiah Smith, Jr. Professor of Law and
Professor of History at Harvard University. In 2010, he
published The Last Utopia: Human Rights in History, and
his most recent book is Christian Human Rights. His areas
of interest in legal scholarship include international law,
human rights, the law of war, and legal thought, in both
historical and current perspectives. In intellectual history,
he has worked on a diverse range of subjects, especially
twentieth-century European moral and political theory.
He has written several books in his fields of European
intellectual history and human rights history. His book
Not Enough: Human Rights in an Unequal World (2018)
is the most recent work. He is currently working on a new book on the origins and
significance of the humane war for Farrar, Straus, and Giroux. Over the years he has
written in venues such as Boston Review, the Chronicle of Higher Education, Dissent,
The Nation, The New Republic, the New York Times, and The Wall Street Journal.
In “Human Rights and the Age of Inequality,” Samuel Moyn deals with the drastic
mismatch between the egalitarian crisis and the human rights remedy that demands
not a substitute but a supplement. He points out that the human rights regime and
movement are simply not equipped to challenge global inequalities.
Introduction
Start with a parable: Imagine that one man owned everything. Call him Croesus,
after the king of ancient lore who, Herodotus says, was so “wonderfully rich” that
he “thought himself the happiest of mortals”. Impossibly elevated above his fellow
men and women though he is, however, this modern Croesus is also remarkably
magnanimous. With his global realm, the modern Croesus outstrips the already
fabulous wealth of his predecessor by a long shot. But he does not want everyone
else to starve, and not only because he needs some of them for the upkeep of his
English: Grade 12

265

global estate. Instead, Croesus insists on a floor of protection, so that everyone
living under his benevolent but total ascendancy can escape utter destitution.
Health, food, water, even paid vacations – Croesus funds them all.
In comparison to the world in which we live today, where few enjoy these
benefits, Croesus offers a kind of utopia. It is the utopia foreseen in the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights (1948)1, whose goal is to provide a list of the most
basic entitlements that humans deserve thanks to being human itself. This utopia
is one that, though little known in its own time, has become our own, with the rise
in the last half-century of the international human rights movement – especially
now that this movement has belatedly turned to mobilization for the economic and
social rights that the Universal Declaration promised from the start.
We increasingly live in Croesus’s world. It now goes without saying that any
enlightened regime respects basic civil liberties, though the struggle to provide
them is compelling and unending. Croesus hates repression and not merely
indigence. He would never consent to a police state; he views the atrocities of
war and occupation with horror; he glows with outrage when the word ‘torture’ is
mentioned; he agrees cruelty is the worst thing we can do. But he also considers
it outrageous, even as the sole inhabitant of the top, to live in a world of socioeconomic destitution at the bottom. So-called ‘social rights’ matter deeply to him.
Croesus’s generosity, then, is as unprecedented as his wealth is. How could anyone
trivialize what Croesus has to offer?
Let me try. For the value of distributive equality – any ceiling on the wealth gap
between rich and poor – is as absent from the Universal Declaration, as well as from
the legal regimes and social movements that take it as their polestar, as it is far from
Croesus’s mind. True, the founding document of human rights announced status
equality: according to its first article, all human beings are born free and equal in
dignity and rights. It may be true that, in a world devastated by the evils of racism and
genocide, the assertion of bare status equality was itself a revolutionary act. Yet this
same status equality implies nothing more. Nothing in the scheme of human rights
rules out Croesus’s world, with its absolute overlordship, so long as it features that
floor of protection.
In itself, Croesus’ willing provision of a floor of protection seems deeply
flawed – immoral even – if it comes together with the most massive inequality
ever seen. This is the point of the thought experiment: to remind us that human
rights, even perfectly realized human rights, are compatible with inequality, even
radical inequality. Staggeringly, we could live in a situation of absolute hierarchy
like Croesus’s world, with human rights norms as they have been canonically
266

English: Grade 12

formulated perfectly respected. Our question is whether we should continue to
idealize Croesus’s world as we continue to make our world more like it every day.
Human rights in the age of national welfare
Writing the history of human rights in relation to that of political economy would
involve two big stages – with a possible missed opportunity in between. The first,
clearly, was the heroic age of the national welfare states after World War II. At that
time, human rights reflected a small part of a larger and universal welfarist consensus
that united the otherwise bitter enemies of the new cold war in 1948 and for two
decades after. Contrary to stereotype, the ‘West’ for a long moment agreed about the
importance of socio-economic rights. Indeed, it was in part out of their own experience
of socio-economic misery, and not only the threatening communist insistence on an
absolute ceiling on inequality, that the capitalist nations signed on so enthusiastically
to welfarism. Of course, America never got as far in answering the welfarist imperative
as those European nations that chose Christian Democracy, social democracy, or (in
the east) communist egalitarianism. But the reigning consensus even in the capitalist
nations in that lost age went far beyond a basic floor of protection to include its own
exacting ideal of a ceiling on inequality, which to a remarkable extent they succeeded
(like the communist nations) in building to accompany their new floor of entitlements.
Indeed, it is perhaps because human rights offered a modest first step rather than a
grand final hope that they were broadly ignored or rejected in the 1940s as the ultimate
formulation of the good life.
The assertion of human rights in the 1940s, in other words, is best understood as
one version of the update to the entitlements of citizenship on whose desirability
and necessity almost everyone agreed after depression and war. Franklin Roosevelt
issued his famous call for a “second Bill of Rights” that included socio-economic
protections in his State of the Union address the year before his death, but the
most important three facts about that call have been almost entirely missed. One is
that it marked a characteristically provincial America’s late and ginger entry into
an already foreordained North Atlantic consensus. A second is that in promising
“freedom from want” and envisioning it “everywhere in the world”, Roosevelt in
fact understated the actually egalitarian aspirations that every version of welfarism
proclaimed, which went far beyond a low bar against indigence so as to guarantee
a more equal society than before (or since). His highest promise, in his speech, was
not a floor of protection for the masses but the end of “special privileges for the
few” – a ceiling on inequality. The last is that though Roosevelt certainly hoped it
would span the globe, it was to be nationally rather than internationally organized
– in stark contrast to the assumptions of both political economy and human rights
English: Grade 12

267

as they have prevailed in our time.
The most interesting truth about human rights in the 1940s, indeed, is not that they were
an optional and normally ignored synonym for a consensus welfarism but that they still
portended a fully national project of reconstruction – just like all other reigning versions
of welfarism. Everywhere in the world, and not least in Roosevelt’s America itself,
welfarism was both announced and achieved on a national basis. The minor exception
of the International Labour Organization to one side, in the 1940s, neither socioeconomic rights nor a more ambitious welfarism were international projects, except
insofar as modular nation-states experimenting with their own arrangements were
supposed to answer to higher values of morality. Of course the Universal Declaration
is international in source and form, but essentially as a template for nations – “a high
standard of achievement for all peoples and nations”, as its own preamble tells us. This
ought to be unsurprising. Welfarism had been national ever since the crisis between the
world wars prompted state-led reconstruction. If ‘national socialism’ did not triumph
as a slogan or a programme after World War II, it was in part because the name was
taken but mainly because a more ecumenical national welfarism– my label – structured
a debate about how far (not whether) the state would intervene into economic affairs
to plan and manage growth, with a range of options from tweaked capitalism to fullblown communism. Indeed, a once more internationalist socialism had been reduced
to the scale of the nation. Having never ascended above it, ‘welfarism in one country’
was the rule where full-blown socialism did not obtain, like various places in Western
and everywhere in Eastern Europe.
Political economy ascended beyond the nation in the 1940s only for the sake of avoiding
catastrophe if individual states failed in their obligation of countercyclical management
of their own economies, never for the sake of either a global floor of protection, let
alone a global ceiling on inequality. As economist and Nobel laureate Gunnar Myrdal
explained laconically, looking back at this consensus about the geographical limits but
relative generosity of post-war distributive justice, “the welfare state is nationalistic”
(Myrdal 1960). The original relation of the Universal Declaration to political economy
was thus the lowest set of guarantees for which the national welfarist experiment
should strive, when conducted in the modular boxes provided – and divided – by
political borders.
The harmony of ideals between the campaign against abjection and the demand for
equality succeeded only nationally, and in mostly North Atlantic states, and then only
partially. Whatever success occurred on both fronts thus came with sharp limitations –
and especially the geographical modesty that the human rights idiom has successfully
268

English: Grade 12

transcended. It is, indeed, as if globalization of the norms of basic protection were a
kind of reward for the relinquishment of the imperative of local equality.
Even the decolonization of the world, though unforeseen at the time of the Universal
Declaration that accommodated itself to the empires of the day, hardly changed this
relationship, since the new states themselves adopted the national welfarist resolve.
The burning question was what would happen after, especially in the face of the
inability of the Global South to transplant national welfarism and the wealth gap that
endures to this day between two sorts of countries: rich and poor.
Another human rights movement?
Could a different form of human rights than the regimes and movements spawned
so far correct this mistake? I doubt it. To be absolutely clear, this is not to contradict
the moral significance and possibly even historical success of human rights when it
comes to their core uses in combating political repression and restraining excessive
violence. But when inequality has been contained in human affairs, it was never on
the sort of individualistic, and often antistatist, basis that human rights do indeed share
with their market fundamentalist Doppelganger. And when it comes to the necessary
mobilizational complement to any programme, the chief tools of the human rights
movements in its most renowned and possibly successful campaigns – the critique of
state repression and the melioration of disasters of war – are simply not fit for use in
the socio-economic domain. It is in part because the human rights movement is not up
to the challenge when it comes to each and every of its self-assigned tasks that it has
been condemned to offer no meaningful alternative, and certainly no serious threat, to
market fundamentalism. The success and prestige of human rights in our day – and
the absence of other political approaches – has bred the mistake of the man who,
lacking anything but a hammer, then treats everything like a nail. Croesus’s world is
safe from the drastic mismatch between need and remedy as human rights regimes and
movements so far can present it.
In Herodotus’s Histories, Solon’s shaming of Croesus merely took him down a peg.
It was only Persian armies that toppled him. The truth is that global socio-economic
justice, like local socio-economic justice, would require redistribution under pressure
from the rich to the poor, something naming and shaming is never likely to achieve,
even when supplemented by novel forms of legal activism. Thinking historically, it
can be no accident that the era of the moderation of inequality in the mid-twentieth
century was also the age of both totalitarian regimes and a cold war that exacted an
appalling toll on the world, including at the hands of the ultimate victor. At the zenith of
national welfare, a floor of protection came linked to a ceiling on inequality, and both
English: Grade 12

269

were built together, only in the presence of frightening internal and external threats – a
workers’ movement and a communist menace. In response to those dangers, change
came thanks to a ‘reformism of fear’ – the working class was placated and untold
violence was brought against enemies, often at home and always abroad.
Yet if the human rights movement at its most inspiring has stigmatized such
repression and violence, it has never offered a functional replacement for
the sense of fear that led to both protection and redistribution for those who
were left alive by twentieth century horror. If a global welfarism is ever to be
brought out the realm of the ideal where it is currently exiled, it will need to
be championed not only as a programme but also by a movement. But it will
not look like our human rights movement, which has become prominent as
our world has become more like Croesus’s world each day. None of this is to
say that human rights activism, to which Amnesty International made such an
epoch-making and defining contribution in the last century, is irrelevant.
The stigmatization of states and communities that fail to protect basic values is – so
long as it is not selective and a smokescreen for great power politics – a tremendous
contribution. But human rights advocates in their current guises do not know how
to stigmatize inequality, and not principles but a new political economy would
have to be invented to actually moderate it. Most of all, history suggests that they
are the wrong kind of agent: not fearful enough to provoke redistribution. Could
a new form of human rights mount such a challenge? Possibly, but it would need
to be so different as to be unrecognizable, and threaten the power to stigmatize in
the face of the violation of basic values that activists have carefully and with much
hard work learned to achieve. If this is correct, human rights movements face a
deeply strategic choice about whether to try to reinvent themselves – or whether to
stand aside on the assumption that as inequality grows, someday its opponent will
arise. Until then, Croesus’s world is our common fate.

One-act Plays
A Matter of Husbands
Ferenc Molnar
Translated by Benjamin Glazer

Before reading
Answer the following questions.
a.
Have you ever watched a play in a theatre?
b.
Can actors use their acting skills in their real life? Why?
Widely regarded as Hungary’s most celebrated and
controversial playwright, Ferenc Molnár’s (1878–1952)
primary aim was to entertain people by transforming
his personal experiences into literary works of art. Out
of his many plays, The Devil (1907), Lilion (1909), The
Guardsman (1910), The Swan (1920), and The Play’s the
Thing (1926) endure as classics. He immigrated to the United
States to escape persecution of Hungarian Jews during World
War II and later adopted American citizenship. Molnár’s plays
continue to be relevant and are performed all over the world.
Published in 1923, A Matter of Husband sheds light on the basic function of actors: to
make the audience believe in illusion.
CHARACTERS
FAMOUS ACTRESS
EARNEST YOUNG WOMAN
[The scene is a drawing room, but a screen, a sofa and a chair will do, provided that
the design and colorings are exotic and suggestive of the apartment of the famous
Hungarian actress in which this dialogue takes place. The time is late afternoon, and
when the curtain rises the Earnest Young Woman is discovered, poised nervously on
the edge of a gilt chair. It is plain she has been sitting there a long time. For perhaps
the fiftieth time she is studying the furnishings of the room and regarding the curtained
door with a glance that would be impatient if it were not so palpably frightened. And
now and then she licks her lips as if her mouth was dry. She is dressed in a very
modest frock and wears her hat and furs. At last the Famous Actress enters through the
curtained door at the right which leads to her boudoir.]
272

English: Grade 12

FAMOUS ACTRESS: You wished to see me?
EARNEST YOUNG WOMAN: [She gulps emotionally] Yes.
FAMOUS ACTRESS: What can I do for you?
EARNEST YOUNG WOMAN: [Extends her arms in a beseeching gesture] Give me
back my husband!
FAMOUS ACTRESS: Give you back your husband!
EARNEST YOUNG WOMAN: Yes. [The FAMOUS ACTRESS only stares at her in
speechless bewilderment.] You are wondering which one he is.... He is a blond man,
not very tall, wears spectacles. He is a lawyer, your manager's lawyer. Alfred is his
first name.
FAMOUS ACTRESS: Oh! I have met him--yes.
EARNEST YOUNG WOMAN: I know you have. I implore you, give him back to
me.
[There is a long pause.]
FAMOUS ACTRESS: You mustn't mistake my silence for embarrassment. I am at a
loss because--I don't quite see how I can give you back your husband when I haven't
got him to give.
EARNEST YOUNG WOMAN: You just admitted that you knew him.
FAMOUS ACTRESS: That scarcely implies that I have taken him from you. Of
course I know him. He drew up my last contract. And it seems to me I have seen him
once or twice since then--backstage. A rather nice-spoken, fair-haired man. Did you
say he wore spectacles?
EARNEST YOUNG WOMAN: Yes.
FAMOUS ACTRESS: I don't remember him with spectacles.
EARNEST YOUNG WOMAN: He probably took them off. He wanted to look his
best to you. He is in love with you. He never takes them off when I'm around. He
doesn't care how he looks when I'm around. He doesn't love me. I implore you, give
him back to me!
FAMOUS ACTRESS: If you weren't such a very foolish young woman I should be
very angry with you. Wherever did you get the idea that I have taken your husband
from you?
EARNEST YOUNG WOMAN: He sends you flowers all the time.
FAMOUS ACTRESS: That's not true.
EARNEST YOUNG WOMAN: It is!
FAMOUS ACTRESS: It isn't. He never sent me a flower in all his life. Did he tell
you he did?
English: Grade 12

273

EARNEST YOUNG WOMAN: No. I found out at the florist's. The flowers are sent
to your dressing room twice a week and charged to him.
FAMOUS ACTRESS: That's a lie.
EARNEST YOUNG WOMAN: Do you mean to say that I am lying?
FAMOUS ACTRESS: I mean to say that someone is lying to you.
EARNEST YOUNG WOMAN: [Fumbles in her bag for a letter] And what about this
letter?
FAMOUS ACTRESS: Letter?
EARNEST YOUNG WOMAN: He wrote it to you. And he said-FAMOUS ACTRESS: He wrote it to me? Let me see.
EARNEST YOUNG WOMAN: No. I'll read it to you. [She opens it and reads
mournfully] "My darling, Shan't be able to call for you at the theater tonight. Urgent
business. A thousand apologies. Ten thousand kisses. Alfred."
FAMOUS ACTRESS: Oh!
EARNEST YOUNG WOMAN: I found it on his desk this morning. He probably
intended to send it to the theater by messenger. But he forgot it. And I opened it. [She
weeps.]
FAMOUS ACTRESS: You mustn't cry.
EARNEST YOUNG WOMAN: [Sobbing] Why mustn't I? You steal my husband
and I mustn't cry! Oh, I know how little it means to you. And how easy it is for you.
One night you dress like a royal princess, and the next night you undress like a Greek
goddess. You blacken your eyebrows and redden your lips and wax your lashes and
paint your face. You have cosmetics and bright lights to make you seem beautiful. An
author's lines to make you seem witty and wise. No wonder a poor, simple-minded
lawyer falls in love with you. What chance have I against you in my cheap little frock,
my own lips and eyebrows, my own unstudied ways? I don't know how to strut and
pose and lure a man. I haven't got Mr. Shakespeare to write beautiful speeches for me.
In reality you may be more stupid than I am, but I admit that when it comes to alluring
men I am no match for you.
FAMOUS ACTRESS: [Without anger, slowly, regards her appraisingly] This is a
very interesting case.
EARNEST YOUNG WOMAN: What is?
FAMOUS ACTRESS: Yours.
EARNEST YOUNG WOMAN: Mine? What do you mean?
FAMOUS ACTRESS: I mean that I never received a flower, or a letter, or anything
else from your husband. Tell me, haven't you and your husband been getting on rather
badly of late?
274

English: Grade 12

EARNEST YOUNG WOMAN: Yes, of course.
FAMOUS ACTRESS: You used to be very affectionate to each other?
EARNEST YOUNG WOMAN: Why, yes.
FAMOUS ACTRESS: And of late you have been quite cold?
EARNEST YOUNG WOMAN: Yes.
FAMOUS ACTRESS: Of course! A typical case.... My dear, if you knew how often
we actresses meet this sort of thing! It is perfectly clear that your husband has been
playing a little comedy to make you jealous, to revive your interest in him.
EARNEST YOUNG WOMAN: [Dumbfounded, staring] Do you really think that?
Do you mean to say such a thing has happened to you before?
FAMOUS ACTRESS: Endless times. It happens to every actress who is moderately
pretty and successful. It is one of the oldest expedients in the world, and we actresses
are such conspicuous targets for it! There is scarcely a man connected with the theater
who doesn't make use of us in that way some time or another--authors, composers,
scene designers, lawyers, orchestra leaders, even the managers themselves. To regain
a wife or sweetheart's affections all they need to do is invent a love affair with one of
us. The wife is always so ready to believe it. Usually we don't know a thing about it.
But even when it is brought to our notice we don't mind so much. At least we have
the consolation of knowing that we are the means of making many a marriage happy
which might otherwise have ended in the divorce court.
EARNEST YOUNG WOMAN: But how--how could I know?
FAMOUS ACTRESS: [With a gracious little laugh] There, dear, you mustn't
apologize. You couldn't know, of course. It seems so plausible. You fancy your husband
in an atmosphere of perpetual temptation, in a backstage world full of beautiful sirens
without scruples or morals. One actress, you suppose, is more dangerous than a
hundred ordinary women. You hate us and fear us. None understands that better than
your husband, who is evidently a very cunning lawyer. And so he plays on your fear
and jealousy to regain the love you deny him. He writes a letter and leaves it behind
him on the desk. Trust a lawyer never to do that unintentionally. He orders flowers for
me by telephone in the morning and probably cancels the order the moment he reaches
his office. By the way, hasn't he a lock of my hair?
EARNEST YOUNG WOMAN: Yes. In his desk drawer. I brought it with me.
FAMOUS ACTRESS: Yes. They bribe my hair-dresser to steal from me. It is a
wonder I have any hair left at all.
EARNEST YOUNG WOMAN: [Happily] Is that how he got it?
FAMOUS ACTRESS: I can't imagine how else. Tell me, hasn't he left any of my love
letters lying around?
EARNEST YOUNG WOMAN: [In alarm] No.
English: Grade 12

275

FAMOUS ACTRESS: Don't be alarmed. I haven't written him any.
EARNEST YOUNG WOMAN: Then what made you--?
FAMOUS ACTRESS: I might have if he had come to me frankly and said: "I say,
Sara, will you do something for me? My wife and I aren't getting on so well. Would
you write me a passionate love letter that I can leave lying around at home where she
may find it?" I should certainly have done it for him. I'd have written a letter that would
have made you weep into your pillow for a fortnight. I wrote ten like that for a very
eminent playwright once. But he had no luck with them. His wife was such a proper
person she returned them all to him unread.
EARNEST YOUNG WOMAN: How clever you are! How good!
FAMOUS ACTRESS: I'm neither better nor worse than any other girl in the theater.
Even though you do consider us such monsters.
EARNEST YOUNG WOMAN: [Contritely] I have been a perfect fool.
FAMOUS ACTRESS: Well, you do look a bit silly, standing there with tears in your
eyes, and your face flushed with happiness because you have discovered that a little
blond man with spectacles loves you, after all. My dear, no man deserves to be adored
as much as that. But then it's your own affair, isn't it?
EARNEST YOUNG WOMAN: Yes.
FAMOUS ACTRESS: Yet I want to give you a parting bit of advice: don't let him
fool you like this again.
EARNEST YOUNG WOMAN: He won't. Never fear!
FAMOUS ACTRESS: No matter what you may find in his pockets--letters,
handkerchiefs, my photograph, no matter what flowers he sends, or letters he writes,
or appointments he makes--don't be taken in a second time.
EARNEST YOUNG WOMAN: You may be sure of that. And you won't say anything
to him about my coming here, will you?
FAMOUS ACTRESS: Not a word. I'm angry with him for not having come to me
frankly for permission to use my name the way he did.
EARNEST YOUNG WOMAN: You are a dear, and I don't know how to thank you.
FAMOUS ACTRESS: Now you mustn't begin crying all over again.
EARNEST YOUNG WOMAN: You have made me so happy!
[She kisses the FAMOUS ACTRESS impetuously, wetting her cheek with tears; then
she rushes out. The door closes behind her. There is a pause.]
FAMOUS ACTRESS: [Goes to the door of her boudoir, calls] All right, Alfred. You
can come in now. She has gone.

Facing Death
August Strindberg

Before reading
Answer the following questions.
a.
Have you ever observe your parents in a financial crisis? If yes, what was it like?
b.
Have you ever appreciated their selfless act for your sake? If yes, how?
Johan August Strindberg (1849–1912) was a Swedish
writer, playwright, and painter. Ranked among Sweden's
most important authors,his works fall into two major
literary movements, Naturalism and Expressionism.
His theater tries to create a perfect illusion of reality
through detailed sets, an unpoetic literary style that
reflects the way real people speak, and a style of acting
that tries to recreate reality. Miss Julie (1888), Facing
Death (1892), A Dream Play (1902), and The Ghost
Sonata (1907) are some of his notable plays.
In Facing Death, Strindberg dramatizes a heroic
sacrifice made by a bankrupt man for the sake of his daughters.

ADÈLE: That would ruin the credit of the house entirely, but you have never done
anything else.
DURAND: Even you, Adèle?
ADÈLE: Even I am tired, though I have held out longest!
DURAND: Yes, you have, and you were still human when Thérèse and Annette
cautioned me. You and I have pulled this house through since mother died. You have
had to sit in the kitchen like Cinderella; I have had to take care of the service, the fires,
sweep and clean, and do the errands. You are tired; how should it be with me, then?
ADÈLE: But you mustn't be tired. You have three daughters who are unprovided for
and whose dowry you have wasted.
DURAND: [Listening without] Doesn't it seem as if you heard the sound of clanging
and rumbling down toward Cully? If fire has broken out they are lost, because the wind
is going to blow soon, the lake tells me that.
ADÈLE: Have you paid the fire insurance on our house?
DURAND: Yes, I have. Otherwise I would never have got that last mortgage.
ADÈLE: How much is there left unmortgaged?
DURAND: A fifth of the fire insurance policy. But you know how property dropped in
value when the railroad passed our gates and went to the east instead.
ADÈLE: So much the better.
DURAND: [Sternly] Adèle! [Pause.] Will you put out the fire in the stove?
ADÈLE: Impossible. I can't till the coffee-bread comes.
DURAND: Well, here it is.
[Pierre comes in with basket. Adèle looks in the basket.]
ADÈLE: No bread! But a bill--two, three-PIERRE: --Well, the baker said he wouldn't send any more bread until he was paid.
And then, when I was going by the butcher's and the grocer's, they shoved these bills
at me. [Goes out.]
ADÈLE: Oh, God in heaven, this is the end for us! But what's this? [Opens a package.]
DURAND: Some candles that I bought for the mass for my dear little Rèné. Today is
the anniversary of his death.
ADÈLE: You can afford to buy such things!
DURAND: With my tips, yes. Don't you think it is humiliating to stretch out my hand
whenever a traveller leaves us? Can't you grant me the only contentment I possess--let
280

English: Grade 12

me enjoy my sorrow one time each year? To be able to live in memory of the most
beautiful thing life ever gave me?
ADÈLE: If he had only lived until now, you'd see how beautiful he'd be!
DURAND: It's very possible that there's truth in your irony--as I remember him,
however, he was not as you all are now.
ADÈLE: Will you be good enough to receive Monsieur Antonio yourself? He is
coming now to have his coffee without bread! Oh, if mother were only living! She
always found a way when you stood helpless.
DURAND: Your mother had her good qualities.
ADÈLE: Although you saw only her faults.
DURAND: Monsieur Antonio is coming. If you leave me now, I'll have a talk with
him.
ADÈLE: You would do better to go out and borrow some money, so that the scandal
would be averted.
DURAND: I can't borrow a sou. After borrowing for ten years! Let everything crash
at once, everything, everything, if it would only be the end!
ADÈLE: The end for you, yes. But you never think of us!
DURAND: No, I have never thought of you, never!
ADÈLE: Do you begrudge us our bringing-up?
DURAND: I am only answering an unjust reproach. Go now, and I'll meet the storm-as usual.
ADÈLE: As usual--h'm!
[Goes. Antonio comes in from back.]
ANTONIO: Good morning, Monsieur Durand.
DURAND: Monsieur Lieutenant has already been out for a walk?
ANTONIO: Yes, I've been down toward Cully and saw them put out a chimney fire.
Now, some coffee will taste particularly good.
DURAND: It's needless to say how it pains me to have to tell you that on account of
insufficient supplies our house can no longer continue to do business.
ANTONIO: How is that?
DURAND: To speak plainly, we are bankrupt.
ANTONIO: But, my good Monsieur Durand, is there no way of helping you out of
what I hope is just a temporary embarrassment?
DURAND: No, there is no possible way out. The condition of the house has been so
completely undermined for many years that I had rather the crash would come than
live in a state of anxiety day and night, expecting what must come.
English: Grade 12

281

ANTONIO: Nevertheless I believe you are looking at the dark side of things.
DURAND: I can't see what makes you doubt my statement.
ANTONIO: Because I want to help you.
DURAND: I don't wish any help. Privation must come and teach my children to lead
a different life from this which is all play. With the exception of Adèle, who really
does take care of the kitchen, what do the others do? Play, and sing, and promenade,
and flirt; and as long as there is a crust of bread in the house, they'll never do anything
useful.
ANTONIO: Granting that, but until the finances are straightened out we must have
bread in the house. Allow me to stay a month longer and I will pay my bill in advance.
DURAND: No, thank you, we must stick to this course even if it leads us into the
lake! And I don't want to continue in this business, which doesn't bring bread--nothing
but humiliations. Just think how it was last spring, when the house had been empty
for three months. Then at last an American family came and saved us. The morning
after their arrival I ran across the son catching hold of my daughter on the stairs. It was
Thérèse,--he was trying to kiss her. What would you have done in my case?
ANTONIO: [Confused] I don't know-DURAND: I know what I, as a father, should have done, but--father-like--I didn't do
it. But I know what to do the next time.
ANTONIO: On account of that very thing it seems to me that you should think very
carefully about what you do, and not leave your daughters to chance.
DURAND: Monsieur Antonio, you are a young man who, for some inexplicable
reason, has won my regard. Whether you grant it, or not, I am going to ask one thing of
you. Don't form any opinions about me as an individual, or about my conduct.
ANTONIO: Monsieur Durand, I promise it if you will answer me one question; are
you Swiss-born, or not?
DURAND: I am a Swiss citizen.
ANTONIO: Yes, I know that, but I ask if you were born in Switzerland.
DURAND: [Uncertainly] Yes.
ANTONIO: I asked only--because it interested me. Nevertheless--as I must believe
you that your pension must be closed, I want to pay what I owe. To be sure it's only ten
francs, but I can't go away and leave an unpaid bill.
DURAND: I can't be sure that this is really a debt, as I don't keep the accounts, but if
you have deceived me you shall hear from me. Now I'll go and get the bread. Afterward
we'll find out.
[Goes out. Antonio alone. Afterward Thérèse comes in, carrying a rat-trap. She wears
a morning negligée and her hair is down.]
282

English: Grade 12

THÉRÈSE: Oh, there you are, Antonio! I thought I heard the old man.
ANTONIO: Yes, he went to get the coffee-bread, he said.
THÉRÈSE: Hadn't he done that already? No, do you know, we can't stand him any
longer.
ANTONIO: How beautiful you are today, Thérèse! But that rat-trap isn't becoming.
THÉRÈSE: And such a trap into the bargain! I have set it for a whole month, but
never, never get a live one, although the bait is eaten every morning. Have you seen
Mimi around?
ANTONIO: That damned cat? It's usually around early and late, but today I've been
spared it.
THÉRÈSE: You must speak beautifully about the absent, and remember, he who
loves me, loves my cat. [She puts rat-trap on the table and picks up an empty saucer
from under table.] Adèle, Adèle!
ADÈLE: [In the kitchen door] What does Her Highness demand so loudly?
THÉRÈSE: Her Highness demands milk for her cat and a piece of cheese for your
rats.
ADÈLE: Go get them yourself.
THÉRÈSE: Is that the way to answer Her Highness?
ADÈLE: The answer fits such talk. And besides, you deserve it for showing yourself
before a stranger with your hair not combed.
THÉRÈSE: Aren't we all old friends here, and--Antonio, go and speak nicely to Aunt
Adele, and then you'll get some milk for Mimi. [Antonio hesitates.] Well, aren't you
going to mind?
ANTONIO: [Sharply] No.
THÉRÈSE: What kind of a way to speak is that? Do you want a taste of my riding
whip?
ANTONIO: Impudence!
THÉRÈSE: [Amazed] What's that? What's that? Are you trying to remind me of my
position, my debt, my weakness?
ANTONIO: No, I only want to remind you of my position, my debt, my weakness.
ADÈLE: [Getting the saucer] Now listen, good friends. What's all this foolishness
for? Be friends--and then I'll give you some very nice coffee. [Goes into the kitchen.]
THÉRÈSE: [Crying] You are tired of me, Antonio, and you are thinking of giving me
up.
ANTONIO: You mustn't cry, it will make your eyes so ugly.
THÉRÈSE: Oh, if they are not as beautiful as Annette's-English: Grade 12

283

ANTONIO: --So, it's Annette now? But now look here; all fooling aside, isn't it about
time we had our coffee?
THÉRÈSE: You'd make a charming married man--not able to wait a moment for your
coffee.
ANTONIO: And what a lovable married lady you would be, who growls at her
husband because she has made a blunder.
[Annette comes in fully dressed and hair done up.]
ANNETTE: You seem to be quarreling this morning.
ANTONIO: See, there's Annette, and dressed already.
THÉRÈSE: Yes, Annette is so extraordinary in every respect, and she also has the
prerogative of being older than I am.
ANNETTE: If you don't hold your tongue-ANTONIO: --Oh, now, now, be good, now, Thérèse!
[He puts his arm around her and kisses her. Monsieur Durand appears in the doorway
as he does so.]
DURAND: [Astonished] What's this?
THÉRÈSE: [Freeing herself] What?
DURAND: Did my eyes see right?
THÉRÈSE: What did you see?
DURAND: I saw that you allowed a strange gentleman to kiss you.
THÉRÈSE: That's a lie!
DURAND: Have I lost my sight, or do you dare lie to my face?
THÉRÈSE: Is it for you to talk about lying, you who lie to us and the whole world by
saying that you were born a Swiss although you are a Frenchman?
DURAND: Who said that?
THÉRÈSE: Mother said so.
DURAND: [To Antonio] Monsieur Lieutenant, as our account is settled, I'll ask you to
leave this house immediately, or else-ANTONIO: Or else?
DURAND: Choose your weapon.
ANTONIO: I wonder what sort of defense you would put up other than the hare's!
DURAND: If I didn't prefer my stick, I should take the gun that I used in the last war.
THÉRÈSE: You have surely been at war--you who deserted!
DURAND: Mother said that, too. I can't fight the dead, but I can fight the living.
[Lifts his walking-stick and goes toward Antonio. Thérèse and Annette throw
284

English: Grade 12

themselves between the men.]
ANNETTE: Think what you are doing!
THÉRÈSE: This will end on the scaffold!
ANTONIO: [Backing away] Good-bye, Monsieur Durand. Keep my contempt--and
my ten francs.
DURAND: [Takes a gold piece from his vest pocket and throws it toward Antonio]
My curses follow your gold, scamp!
[Thérèse and Annette following Antonio.]
THÉRÈSE and ANNETTE: Don't go, don't leave us! Father will kill us!
DURAND: [Breaks his stick in two] He who cannot kill must die.
ANTONIO: Good-bye, and I hope you'll miss the last rat from your sinking ship.
[He goes.]
THÉRÈSE: [To Durand] That's the way you treat your guests! Is it any wonder the
house has gone to pieces!
DURAND: Yes--that's the way--such guests! But tell me, Thérèse, my child--[Takes
her head between his hands] tell me, my beloved child, tell me if I saw wrong just now,
or if you told a falsehood.
THÉRÈSE: [Peevishly] What?
DURAND: You know what I mean. It isn't the thing itself, which can be quite innocent-but it is a matter of whether I can trust my senses that interests me.
THÉRÈSE: Oh, talk about something else.--Tell us rather what we are going to eat
and drink today. For that matter, it's a lie; he didn't kiss me.
DURAND: It isn't a lie. In Heaven's name, didn't I see it happen?
THÉRÈSE: Prove it.
DURAND: Prove it? With two witnesses or--a policeman! [To Annette.] Annette, my
child, will you tell me the truth?
ANNETTE: I didn't see anything.
DURAND: That's a proper answer. For one should never accuse one's sister. How like
your mother you are today, Annette!
ANNETTE: Don't you say anything about mother! She should be living such a day
as this!
[Adèle comes in with a glass of milk, which she puts on the table.]
ADÈLE: [To Durand] There's your milk. What happened to the bread?
DURAND: Nothing, my children. It will continue to come as it always has up to the
present.
THÉRÈSE: [Grabs the glass of milk from her father] You shall not have anything, you
English: Grade 12

285

who throw away money, so that your children are compelled to starve.
ADÈLE: Did he throw away money, the wretch? He should have been put in the
lunatic asylum the time mother said he was ripe for it. See, here's another bill that came
by way of the kitchen.
[Durand takes the bill and starts as he looks at it. Pours a glass of water and drinks. Sits
down and lights his briar pipe.]
ANNETTE: But he can afford to smoke tobacco.
DURAND: [Tired and submissively] Dear children, this tobacco didn't cost me any
more than that water, for it was given to me six months ago. Don't vex yourselves
needlessly.
THÉRÈSE: [Takes matches away] Well, at least you shan't waste the matches.
DURAND: If you knew, Thérèse, how many matches I have wasted on you when I
used to get up nights to see if you had thrown off the bedclothes! If you knew, Annette,
how many times I have secretly given you water when you cried from thirst, because
your mother believed that it was harmful for children to drink!
THÉRÈSE: Well, all that was so long ago that I can't bother about it. For that matter,
it was only your duty, as you have said yourself.
DURAND: It was, and I fulfilled my duty and a little more too.
ADÈLE: Well, continue to do so, or no one knows what will become of us. Three
young girls left homeless and friendless, without anything to live on! Do you know
what want can drive one to?
DURAND: That's what I said ten years ago, but no one would heed me; and twenty
years ago I predicted that this moment would come, and I haven't been able to prevent
its coming. I have been sitting like a lone brakeman on an express train, seeing it go
toward an abyss, but I haven't, been able to get to the engine valves to stop it.
THÉRÈSE: And now you want thanks for landing in the abyss with us.
DURAND: No, my child, I only ask that you be a little less unkind to me. You have
cream for the cat, but you begrudge milk to your father, who has not eaten for--so long.
THÉRÈSE: Oh, it's you, then, who has begrudged milk for my cat!
DURAND: Yes, it's I.
ANNETTE: And perhaps it is he who has eaten the rats' bait, too.
DURAND: It is he.
ADÈLE: Such a pig!
THÉRÈSE: [Laughing] Think if it had been poisoned!
DURAND: Alas, if only it had been, you mean!
THÉRÈSE: Yes, you surely wouldn't have minded that, you who have so often talked
about shooting yourself--but have never done it!
286

English: Grade 12

DURAND: Why didn't you shoot me? That's a direct reproach. Do you know why
I haven't done it? To keep you from going into the lake, my dear children.--Say
something less unkind now. It's like hearing music--tunes that I recognize--from the
good old times-ADÈLE: Stop such useless talk now and do something. Do something.
THÉRÈSE: Do you know what the consequences may be if you leave us in this shape?
DURAND: You will go and prostitute yourselves. That's what your mother always
said she'd do when she had spent the housekeeping money on lottery tickets.
ADÈLE: Silence! Not a word about our dear, beloved mother!
DURAND: [Half humming to himself]
In this house a candle burns,
When it burns out the goal he earns,
The goal once won, the storm will come
With a great crash. Yes! No!
[It has begun to blow outside and grown cloudy. Durand rises quickly.]
DURAND: [To Adèle] Put out the fire in the stove. The wind storm is coming.
ADÈLE: [Looking Durand in the eyes] No, the wind is not coming.
DURAND: Put out the fire. If it catches fire here, we'll get nothing from the insurance.
Put out the fire, I say, put it out.
ADÈLE: I don't understand you.
DURAND: [Looks in her eyes, taking her hand] Just obey me, do as I say. [Adèle
goes into kitchen, leaving the door open. To Thérèse and Annette.] Go up and shut the
windows, children, and look after the draughts. But come and give me a kiss first, for
I am going away to get money for you.
THÉRÈSE: Can you get money?
DURAND: I have a life insurance that I think I am going to realize on.
THÉRÈSE: How much can you get for it?
DURAND: Six hundred francs if I sell it, and five thousand if I die. [Thérèse concerned.]
Now, tell me, my child,--we mustn't be needlessly cruel,--tell me, Thérèse, are you so
attached to Antonio that you would be quite unhappy if you didn't get him?
THÉRÈSE: Oh, yes!
DURAND: Then you must marry him if he really loves you. But you mustn't be unkind
to him, for then you'll be unhappy. Good-bye, my dear beloved child. [Takes her in his
arms and kisses her cheeks.]
THÉRÈSE: But you mustn't die, father, you mustn't.
DURAND: Would you grudge me going to my peace?
English: Grade 12

287

THÉRÈSE: No, not if you wish it yourself. Forgive me, father, the many, many times
I've been unkind to you.
DURAND: Nonsense, my child.
THÉRÈSE: But no one was so unkind to you as I.
DURAND: I felt it less because I loved you most. Why, I don't know. But run and shut
the windows.
THÉRÈSE: Here are your matches, papa--and there's your milk.
DURAND: [Smiling] Ah, you child!
THÉRÈSE: Well, what can I do? I haven't anything else to give you.
DURAND: You gave me so much joy as a child that you owe me nothing. Go now, and
just give me a loving look as you used to do. [Thérèse turns and throws herself into his
arms.] So, so, my child, now all is well. [Thérèse runs out.] Farewell, Annette.
ANNETTE: Are you going away? I don't understand all this.
DURAND: Yes, I'm going.
ANNETTE: But of course, you're coming back, papa.
DURAND: Who knows whether he will live through the morrow? Anyway, we'll say
farewell.
ANNETTE: Adieu, then, father--and a good journey to you. And you won't forget to
bring something home to us just as you used to do, will you?
DURAND: And you remember that, though it's so long since I've bought anything for
you children? Adieu, Annette. [Annette goes. Durand hums to himself.] Through good
and evil, great and small, Where you have sown, others gather all. [Adèle comes in.]
Adèle, come, now you shall hear and understand. If I speak in veiled terms, it is only
to spare your conscience in having you know too much. Be quiet. I've got the children
up in their rooms. First you are to ask me this question, "Have you a life insurance
policy?" Well?
ADÈLE: [Questioningly and uncertain] "Have you a life insurance policy?"
DURAND: No, I had one, but I sold it long ago, because I thought I noticed that
someone became irritable when it was due. But I have a fire insurance. Here are the
papers. Hide them well. Now, I'm going to ask you something; do you know how many
candles there are in a pound, mass candles at seventy-five centimes?
ADÈLE: There are six.
DURAND: [Indicating the package of candles] How many candles are there?
ADÈLE: Only five.
DURAND: Because the sixth is placed very high up and very near-ADÈLE: --Good Lord!
DURAND: [Looking at his watch] In five minutes or so, it will be burned out.
288

English: Grade 12

ADÈLE: No!
DURAND: Yes! Can you see dawn any other way in this darkness?
ADÈLE: No.
DURAND: Well, then. That takes care of the business. Now about another matter. If
Monsieur Durand passes out of the world as an [Whispers] incendiary, it doesn't matter
much, but his children shall know that he lived as a man of honor up to that time. Well,
then, I was born in France, but I didn't have to admit that to the first scamp that came
along. Just before I reached the age of conscription I fell in love with the one who later
became my wife. To be able to marry, we came here and were naturalized. When the
last war broke out, and it looked as if I was going to carry a weapon against my own
country, I went out as a sharpshooter against the Germans. I never deserted, as you
have heard that I did--your mother invented that story.
ADÈLE: Mother never lied-DURAND: --So, so. Now the ghost has risen and stands between us again. I cannot
enter an action against the dead, but I swear I am speaking the truth. Do you hear?
And as far as your dowry is concerned, that is to say your maternal inheritance, these
are the facts: first, your mother through carelessness and foolish speculations ruined
your paternal inheritance so completely that I had to give up my business and start this
pension. After that, part of her inheritance had to be used in the bringing-up of you
children, which of course cannot be looked upon as thrown away. So it was also untrue
that-ADÈLE: No, that's not what mother said on her death-bed-DURAND: --Then your mother lied on her death-bed, just as she had done all through
her life. And that's the curse that has been following me like a spook. Think how you
have innocently tortured me with these two lies for so many years! I didn't want to
put disquiet into your young lives which would result in your doubting your mother's
goodness. That's why I kept silent. I was the bearer of her cross throughout our married
life; carried all her faults on my back, took all the consequences of her mistakes on
myself until at last I believed that I was the guilty one. And she was not slow, first to
believe herself to be blameless, and then later the victim. "Blame it on me," I used to
say, when she had become terribly involved in some tangle. And she blamed and I bore!
But the more she became indebted to me, the more she hated me, with the limitless
hatred of her indebtedness. And in the end she despised me, trying to strengthen herself
by imagining she had deceived me. And last of all she taught you children to despise
me, because she wanted support in her weakness. I hoped and believed that this evil
but weak spirit would die when she died; but evil lives and grows like disease, while
soundness stops at a certain point and then retrogrades. And when I wanted to change
what was wrong in the habits of this household, I was always met with "But mother
said," and therefore it was true; "Mother used to do this way," and therefore it was
English: Grade 12

289

right. And to you I became a good-for-nothing when I was kind, a miserable creature
when I was sensitive, and a scamp when I let you all have your way and ruin the house.
ADÈLE: It's honorable to accuse the dead who can't defend themselves!
DURAND: [Fast and exalted] I am not dead yet, but I will be soon. Will you defend
me then? No, you need not. But defend your sisters. Think only of my children, Adèle.
Take a motherly care of Thérèse; she is the youngest and liveliest, quick for good and
bad, thoughtless but weak. See to it that she marries soon, if it can be arranged. Now,
I can smell burning straw.
ADELE: Lord protect us!
DURAND: [Drinks from glass] He will. And for Annette you must try to find a place
as teacher, so that she can get up in the world and into good company. You must
manage the money when it falls due. Don't be close, but fix up your sisters so that
they will be presentable to the right kind of people. Don't save anything but the family
papers, which are in the top drawer of my chiffonier in the middle room. Here is the
key. The fire insurance papers you have. [Smoke is seen forcing its way through the
ceiling.] It will soon be accomplished now. In a moment you will hear the clanging
from St. François. Promise me one thing. Never divulge this to your sisters. It would
only disturb their peace for the rest of their lives. [He sits by the table.] And one thing
more, never a hard word against their mother. Her portrait is also in the chiffonier;
none of you knew that, because I found it was enough that her spirit walked unseen in
the home. Greet Thérèse, and ask her to forgive me. Don't forget that she must have
the best when you buy her clothes; you know her weakness for such things and to what
her weakness can bring her. Tell Annette-[A distant clanging of bells is heard; the smoke increases. Monsieur Durand drops his
head in his hands on the table.]
ADÈLE: It's burning, it's burning! Father, what's the matter with you? You'll be burned
up! [Durand lifts his head, takes the water glass up and puts it down with a meaningful
gesture.] You have--taken--poison!
DURAND: [Nods affirmatively] Have you got the insurance papers? Tell Thérèse-and Annette-[His head falls. The bell in distance strikes again. Rumbling and murmur of voices
outside.]

In his famous essay “The Experimental Novel,” Emile Zola says:
This is what constitutes the experimental novel: to possess a knowledge of the
mechanism of the phenomena inherent in man, to show the machinery of his
intellectual and sensory manifestations, under the influences of heredity and
environment, such as physiology shall give them to us, and then finally to exhibit

How do you take care of your domestic animal or pet?

Bhimnidhi Tiwari (1911-1973) is a well-known poet, story
writer and dramatist from Nepal. An ardent social reformer,
Tiwari established Nepal Natak Sangh (Nepal Drama Society) in
1949. Through this organization, he promoted the Nepali plays by
staging plays and encouraging the Nepali writers to write plays. In
order to sustain this organization, he also wrote plays like Matoko
Maya, Shilanyas and Sahansheela Sushila, among others. Tiwari
won Madan Puraskar for literature in 1970.
It was the late eighteenth century. Ranabahadur Shah, the grandson
of Prithvi Narayan Shah, was the king of Nepal. Ranabahadur Shah was fond of bulls.
In his one act play “The Bull,” Bhimnidhi Tiwari dramatizes an incident related to
Ranabahadur Shah’s craze for bulls to make a biting satire on the feudal system, which
dehumanizes human beings to such an extent that their existence depends on their
deferential treatment towards the four-footed animals like bulls.
A preceding history
(King Ranabahadur Shah was fond of rearing four-footed animals. Among the fourfooted animals, too, he was especially avid about rearing bulls. He was the very person
to start a custom of releasing a bull with a burnt mark every month at Pashupatinath
Temple. He was the one, who had maintained Thulo Gauchar (a large cow pasture),
where an airport has been built now). Among many bulls reared by him, a bull named
'Male' fell sick. 'You would get shaved if you came to tell me that a bull died', he had
threatened the bull doctor. The bull died. Taking the events following the bull's death,
this One Act Play has been written. –Playwright)

Jitman- Cowherd
Gore- Cowherd
Scene I
Place- Yard
Time- Dawn
Month- Ashwin (V.S. 1854)
[Birds are chirping in the trees. The red sun shines on the yard and the body of
Laxminarayan. He is squatting on the carpet.]
Laxmi- (Looking towards the backstage) How immoral and carefree have you all
become? I could not be happy even after having seven wives. I am waiting for having
a puff of hookah. Nobody brings it. (Shouting) Hey, flat-nosed one! Hey, beautiful
one! Hey, butterfly! Hey, swallow! The eldest one! Hey, the one with ugly face! May
you all die at once! All pretend as if they have not heard even after hearing. There is
nothing else except rivalry in each and everything.
(Jitman and Gore arrive there, running out of breath.)
What's the matter? How is the bull?
Gore- (Greeting) He died, baje! The bull died.
Laxmi- (Startled) Huh?
Jitman- (Greeting) He has just died.
Laxmi- Has he already died?
Jitman- He stretched body and his eyes have grown still.
Gore- His tail has gone loose.
Laxmi- Now your father will kill us. He will get me shaved. You both will be beheaded.
We are doomed!
Jitman- (Frightened) What should we do, baje? Should I run away to my home at
Dhunibesi? I love my younger son.
Gore- (Frightened) What should we do,baje? You should save our life. Life is a big
deal.
Laxmi- How will your life be saved? He got my mouth burnt for speaking in a loud
voice. A black patch is still visible. No moustache grows on this side. Now the bull has
died. How will life be saved?
(Thinking for a while) But wait. I will try my best to save you both. How am I going to
save myself? How did that young bull die?

Gore- It's not good to utter big words with this small mouth. How can the kind which
lives on grass digest the fine rice and the lentil soup of split red gram? Prices have
risen because of this. The price of one pathi rice has reached one rupee. The price of
one dharni ghee has reached ten ana. Humans don't get to have the snacks of maize.
He would have guavas, bananas, and sticks of sugarcane in snacks. Not just one or two
days.
Jitman- That's true. We have to sleep on the straw in the winter. Mattress, quilt,
mosquito net for that beast. Oh God!
Laxmi- You’re right. Go and stay in the cowshed. Don't utter ‘The bull is dead’ from
your mouth in any case. Keep taking care of it. I go to the palace right now. Let's see
what happens.
If I don't go, I have many enemies. If somebody reported to the king about it, no hope
for survival would be left.
Go! (Looking towards the backstage) Hey, Khatri! Get the horse ready.
(The cowherds go away. One wife fills hookah and brings it with a pipe)
I am about to lose my property. I am about to get shaved. How can I have hookah in
such a situation? (Scolding) Take it back.
(He goes. The wife keeps standing there, bewildered.)
Scene II
Place- A courtyard of Basantapur Palace
Time/Month- Same (After a while)
(After arriving there, Laxminarayan reverently keeps standing looking up
towards the window)
Ranabahadur- (In a commanding voice from the backstage) What's the matter?
Laxmi- (Bowing down quite low) Swosti! Swosti!Swosti!Your Majesty!
Ranabahdur- Why have you come here, Dahal? Hey, Lachchhe! Why are you here so
early in the morning?
Laxmi- (In a very polite way, joining two hands) If I don't ask for Your Majesty's
favour, the issue is such that I must beg for your favour, Your Majesty. If I ask for
Your Majesty's favour, I feel intolerable burning pain within. I don't know what has
happened to the bull sir. The sun has already gone high in the sky. He does not wake
up. We served him breakfast. He didn't eat either. He does not move or speak. He is
sleeping as if he is relaxed.
Ranabahadur- Huh? What did you say? Has he died?
Laxmi- He is staring with his still eyes.
Ranabahadur- Wait. Wait. I will come down right there.

Laxmi- (Wiping tears from forehead; taking deep breath) Hey Ram! Hey Krishna!!
(After a while)
(Laxminarayan stands more reverently. Entry of Raabahadur)
Ranabahadur- Huh? What did you say? Has he died?
Laxmi- He has not passed away yet.
Ranabahadur- What do you say now?
Laxmi- Your Majesty! In spite of being human beings, all people are not alike. Your
Majesty is a human being. So is a beggar. Your Majesty's name, fame and deeds!
Worshipped all over the nation! What generosity! And this lowly beggar Brahmin!
Likewise, in spite of being bulls, all are not alike. Male Sir's solid body! That beauty!
That style of walking! That valiant fighting! Other bulls are not comparable to him at
all. I am anxious about his health. Shall I move him to the hill comfortably for a change
of climate before the temperature rises? I will act as per Your Majesty's order.
Ranabahdur- Okay. Take him immediately. Do you need the supporting soldiers?
Laxmi- He will have more comfort with the cowherds rather than the soldiers. The
cowherds have understood all of his desires. They know how and what will make him
feel comfortable.
Ranabahadur- Go. You should also accompany them.
Laxmi- Your Majesty! This beggar will also go-I have to take pulse and administer
medicine from time to time. Shall I take leave now?
Ranabahadur- Go. Take him away with a great care.
Laxmi- (Cheerfully) His Majesty! Swosti! Swosti!Swosti!
(Whereas Ranabahadur goes inside, Laxminarayan goes outside)
Ranabahadur- (Entering again) Dahal! Dahal! Dahal! Lachchhe! Look here! Look
at this side!
Laxmi- (Entering) His Majesty!
Ranabahdur- I will go to see him. If he gets better after treating here, why should we
take him to the hill? Why should we give him a trouble without any reason?
Laxmi- (Bowing and joining two hands) The medicine administered here has relieved
him a bit but it has not cured him. Perhaps, he needs a change in climate.
Ranabahadur- I will see him once. (Looking towards the backstage) We are
undertaking a convoy. Get the palanquin ready. Dahal, understood? We have to go
together. Wait for me outside the door.
Laxmi- Your Majesty!
(Both go.)

Scene III
Place- A cowshed at ThuloGauchar
Time- Morning
Month- Same
(The bull is lying dead on a thick mattress. Jitman and Gore are squatting.)
Jitmman- We have been two brothers till today. Now we are going to be four brothers.
Gore- Will he behead us?
Jitman- How will we get to survive?
Gore- Dahalbaje has gone to see the king. Let's see what decision he brings.
Jitman- He is such a cunning man. He has access to the king. He will survive. We will
be victims. We’d better escape.
Gore- Where could the wethers of the pen escape? They will bring us back and behead
us. (Look far) Look! Look, Jite! The king seems to be on his convoy.
Jitman- (Looking) Yes. The palanquin at the front. Baje is following on foot. After
baje, Khatri is walking the horse.
Gore- What to do? We will get killed today.
Jitman- This stupid bull. He died and he will get us killed now.
Gore- Look. The palanquin has stopped. Look, the convoy has come out in the
meadow. (Alarmed) Look, look! How fast the convoy is moving! See, I don't know
why but Dahalbaje is running towards us, ahead of others.
Jitman- What will he say now?
(Entering and speaking in a hurry) You massage the hind feet. You wave the fan from
the front. Bow down. Don't look up. Don't utter the bull died from your mouth. Get
started. There is no guarantee whether you will die or live.
(Jitman starts massaging the hind legs of the bull. Gore starts waving a fan from the
front. Nearby Laxminarayan starts grinding medicine fast.)
Ranabahadur- (Entering, and in a commanding voice) Male! Eh, Male! What
happened to you? Get up! Get up!
Laxmi- Since midnight, Your Majesty! Till now (Pointing towards Jitman), he
is massaging the feet. (Pointing towards Gore) He is waving the fan. I have been
preparing and administering medicine. Bull sir swallows medicine. Neither does he
get up, nor does he move. Neither does he bellow, nor does he eat anything. He is only
listening to us. He keeps staring.
Ranabahdur- Huh? What happened to him? Male? Get up! Are there any fruits? Bring
them, Dahal!
(Going out, Laxminarayan brings a hand of bananas immediately.)
English: Grade 12

297

Laxmi- Bananas, Your Majesty!
Ranabahadur- (Extending bananas to the mouth of the bull) Eat! Dahal, what
happened to him? He does not breathe. He does not eat either. He seems to have died.
Laxmi- He has been looking so well with his eyes.
Ranabahadur- Look, his ears have drooped down. His tail has loosened. He has died.
What climate do you make him change? He has died.
(Right after hearing that the bull has died, Jitman starts crying, placing his head on
the thigh of the bull. Seeing that, Gore also stops waving the fan. He falls down on the
horns of the bull and starts crying.)
Jitman- (Crying) I took care of you so much from your childhood. I brushed you and
massaged your feet so much. Today you have gone, leaving me an orphan, bull sir.
Where have you gone? (To Ranabahadur, drumming his chest) His Majesty! What
should I do now? I am burning within.
Ranabahadur- Hey cowherd! Why do you cry? It has died. What can we do about
that?
Jitman- My heart doesn't accept it, Your Majesty! No, it doesn't. My Male! What
should I do? What sort of fate do I have?
Ranabahadur- Hey Dahal! Console him.
Laxmi- How would he accept? How would he be consoled? He has been immensely
hurt.
Ranabahadur- Don't cry. You have received a tip of four hundred rupees. Shut up
now. (Right after hearing that Jitman has received a tip of four hundred rupees, Gore
also starts sobbing, falling at the feet of the bull.)
Gore- For the sake of your care, I didn't think of anything- home, mother, father, wife
and children. Bull sir, I will go with you. Either will I hang myself to death or I will get
buried with you. I can't leave you. (Drumming his chest) I can't. I can't.
Ranabahadur- Hey, Dahal. Console him, too.
Laxmi- You will receive a favour from His Majesty. He has suffered to the limit, Your
Majesty. Don't cry. He would not let even a single fly sit on the bull’s body. He would
wave the fan day and night. He would take care of the bull all the time. Right after
waking up, he would bow to all the four feet of the bull, saying 'This is my father'. He
has become an orphan, a helpless one.
Gore- (Crying inconsolably) Your Majesty! What should I do? Instead of him, I should
have died.
Ranabahadur- Shut up. You will also receive a tip of five hundred rupees. Don't cry.
Laxmi- (Acting as if the agony has come out from the navel itself, and in a choked
throat) For the sake of the bull sir, I also didn't think of hunger, thirst and sleep. Even
by compromising my chakari to Your Majesty, I took care of him night and morning.

If he was living till today, what facilities I would receive! Whom to say? My own fate
is broken. I administered all types of syrups and medicines. His body had grown really
strong and healthy. At such tender age, he had already grown into a valiant fighter,
defeating all other bulls. At such a rising youth, right in front of my eyes . . . (Failing
to control himself, he sobs.)
Ranabahadur- (Scolding) A weakling who has become Subedar of the company and
a bichari. Why do you cry? Can't you console yourself? Shut up! (Leaving) Bury him
with your own hand. You perform its funeral rites. Make all the offerings to the priest
on your own. I will take care of your worries. (He goes away.)
(Laxminarayan also follows him.)
(After a while)
Jitman- God! We survived. (Wiping out sweat with his cap) This carrion almost got
us killed!
Gore- I thought I was done for. (Waving the fan at himself, taking a deep breath)
Thank God, we survived!
